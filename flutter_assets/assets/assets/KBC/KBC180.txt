Psalm 123:1-2
topic:scripture
=
To Thee do I lift up my eyes, O Thou,
Who art enthroned in the heavens!
(Repeat)

Behold, as the eyes of servants
Look to the hand of their master,
As the eyes of a maid
Look to the hand of her mistress;

So our eyes look to the Lord our God.
So our eyes look to the Lord our God.

Until He shall be gracious to us.
