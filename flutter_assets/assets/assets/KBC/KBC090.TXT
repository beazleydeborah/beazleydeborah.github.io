I love Your grace
I love Your mercy
I love the way You help me when I fall
I love Your truth
I love the power of Your name
But You know I love Your presence
Most of all

My soul takes refuge
In the shadow of Your wings
Close to You is where I want to be
You are my strength
You are my God
You are my King
And all I want is what You want for me

I love Your grace
I love Your mercy
I love the way You help me when I fall
I love Your truth
I love the power of Your name
But You know I love Your presence
Most of all
