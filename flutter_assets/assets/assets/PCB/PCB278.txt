I'm Justified
=
Most Holy Judge I stood before You guilty,
When You sent Jesus to the cross for my sin.
There Your love was revealed,
Your justice vindicated;
One sacrifice has paid the cost
For all who trust in Jesus.
=
Now I'm justified, You declare me righteous;
Justified by the blood of the Lamb.
Justified freely by Your mercy,
By faith I stand and I'm justified.
=
I come to You and I can call You Father,
There is no fear, there is no shame before You.
For by Your gift of grace,
Now I am one of Your children;
An heir with those who bear Your name
And share the hope of glory.
=
Now I'm justified, You declare me righteous;
Justified by the blood of the Lamb.
Justified freely by Your mercy,
By faith I stand and I'm justified.
