Eternal God unchanging
Mysterious and unknown
Your boundless love unfailing
In grace and mercy shown 

Bright seraphim in ceaseless flight
Around Your glorious throne
They raise their voices day and night
In praise to You alone 
=
Hallelujah
Glory be to our great God
Hallelujah
Glory be to our great God

Lord we are weak and frail
Helpless in the storm
Surround us with Your angels
Hold us in Your arms

Our cold and ruthless enemy
His pleasure is our harm
Rise up O Lord and he will flee
Before our sovereign God
=
Let every creature in the sea and
Every flying bird
Let every mountain every field
And valley of the earth

Let all the moons and all the stars
In all the universe
Sing praises to the living God
Who rules them by His Word
