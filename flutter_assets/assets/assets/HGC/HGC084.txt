Though Satan should buffet,
though trials should come,
let this blest assurance control, 
that Christ has regarded 
my helpless estate,
and hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin - Oh, the bliss of 
this glorious thought
my sin, not in part but the whole, 
is nailed to the cross 
and I bear it no more! 
praise the Lord,
praise the Lord, O my soul!
=
And, Lord haste the day 
when the faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll, 
the trump shall resound 
and the Lord shall descend!
Even so - it is well with my soul!
