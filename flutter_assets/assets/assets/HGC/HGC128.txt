O sacred Head, now wounded,
E    Am        E     E7      Am%
With grief and shame weighed down;

Now scornfully surrounded
E    Am           E    Am%
With thorns Thine only crown;
    Dm       Am   G7   F C%
How art Thou pale with anguish,
     F    C Dm      A%
With sore abuse and scorn.
D7  G         C G    C  D7 G%
How does that visage languish
C     Dm   C   G7        C%
Which once was bright as morn!

What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered
Was all for sinners' gain:
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Savior.
'Tis I deserve Thy place;
Look on me with Thy favor,
Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.

What language shall I borrow 
To thank Thee, dearest Friend:
For this Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end? 
O make me Thine forever;
And should I fainting be, 
Lord, let me never, never
Outlive my love to Thee.
