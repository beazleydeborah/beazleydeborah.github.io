He is tender and loving
and patient with me,
While He cleanses my heart of its dross;
But "there's no condemnation,"
I know I am free,
For my sins are all nailed to the cross.
=
I will cling to my Savior
and never depart -
I will joyfully journey each day
With a song on my lips
and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away.
