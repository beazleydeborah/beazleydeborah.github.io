My hope is built on nothing less
E    A                B        E%
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
                     B%
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
E    A             B      E%
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

On Christ the solid rock I stand;

All other ground is sinking sand,

When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.
=
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
