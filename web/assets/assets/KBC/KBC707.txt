Across the ocean to Cyprus Island
they ventured out on their own,

They blinded Elymas and saved
Sergius Paulus and went on their way
in the Lord.
(repeat)

Just go and pray
and preach the gospel to any person,
Go and pray and tell somebody today.
=
John Mark went with them across
the water to cure the sin of the heart,

But lacking conviction and
homesick and sorry he went back
to where he did start.
(repeat)

Just go and pray
and preach the gospel to any person,
Go and pray and tell somebody today.

and people came and heard, oh yeah!

Way out to Asia they spread the gospel
and churches sprang up from ev'rywhere,

Paul is the leader and Barnabas teacher,
in ev'rything willing to share.
(repeat)

Just go and pray
and preach the gospel to any person,
Go and pray and tell somebody today.
=
Back home in Israel they greet the brethren
but troubled answers are all they hear,

The Jewish believers are binding
their brothers in ritual law and in fear.
The Jewish believers are soundly refuted
by Paul and his friends then and there.

Just go and pray
and preach the gospel to any person,
Go and pray and tell somebody today.

Now Paul is anxious to take the gospel
to ev'ryone in the dark,

It's time to revisit the churches in Asia,
But Barnabas wanted John Mark,
(repeat)

Paul and Silas now preach the gospel,
Paul and Silas now preach the Word;
Paul and Silas now preach the gospel
and people came and heard, Oh yeah!
People came and heard.

Just go and pray
and preach the gospel to any person,
Go and pray and tell somebody today!
