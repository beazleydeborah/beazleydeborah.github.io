God Bless The U.S.A.
=
If tomorrow all the things were gone
I've worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
I'd thank my God above
To be living here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away hey
=
I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
=
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
There's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
=
I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
