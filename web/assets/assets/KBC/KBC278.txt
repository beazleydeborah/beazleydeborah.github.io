Everlasting God

Strength will rise
as we wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
(repeat)
=
Our God, You reign forever
Our hope, our Strong Deliverer
=
You are the everlasting God
The everlasting God
You do not faint
You won't grow weary

You're the defender of the weak
You comfort those in need
You lift us up
On wings like eagles
