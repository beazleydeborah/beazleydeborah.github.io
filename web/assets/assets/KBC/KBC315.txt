Untold millions
=
Untold millions are still untold
Untold millions are still outside the fold
Who will tell them of Jesus' love
And the heavenly mansions awaiting above
Jesus died on Calvary to save each one from sin
=
Now he calls to you and to me
To go and bring them in
For many untold millions are still untold
Untold millions are outside the fold
Who will tell them of Jesus' love
And the heavenly mansions awaiting above
