I Will Call Upon The Lord
=
I will call upon the Lord,   (echo)
Who is worthy to be praised;  (echo)
So shall I be saved from my enemies.  (echo)

The Lord liveth and blessed be the Rock
And may the God of my salvation be exalted.
The Lord liveth and blessed be the Rock
And may the God of my salvation be exalted.
