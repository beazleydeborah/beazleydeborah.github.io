Trust And Obey
=
When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His word
What a glory He sheds on our way
While we do His good will
He abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey
=
Trust and obey
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus
But to trust and obey
=
Not a shadow can rise
Not a cloud in the skies
But His smile quickly drives it away
Not a doubt or a fear
Not a sigh nor a tear
Can abide while we trust and obey
=
Trust and obey
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus
But to trust and obey
