How can I say thanks
For the things You have done for me
Things so underserved,
Yet You give to prove Your love for me?
The voices of a millions angels
Could not express my gratitude
All that I am and ever hope to be,
I owe it all to Thee.
=
To God be the glory, to God be the glory,
To God be the glory
For the things He has done!
=
With His blood He has saved me,
With His pow'r He has raised me
To God be the glory
For the things He has done!
=
Just let me live my life
Let it be pleasing, Lord, to Thee;
And should I gain any praise,
Let it go to Calvary.
