Father in heaven how we love you
We lift Your name in all the earth
May Your kingdom be established
   in our praises
As Your people declare your mighty works

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
Who reigns forevermore
=
Oh God most holy we adore You
We lay our all before Your throne
May the fragrance of Your presence
   be about us
As we purpose to worship You alone

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
Who reigns forevermore
