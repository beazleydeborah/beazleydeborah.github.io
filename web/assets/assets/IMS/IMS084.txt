I want to praise you, Lord

I want to praise you, Lord,
Much more than I do.
I want to praise you, Lord,
Much more than I do.
Learn to seek Your face
And the knowledge of your grace,
I want to praise you.

...(love)...(serve)...(praise)

Birds in the sky sing their songs to you
Trees in the fields lift their arms to you
I want to sing, I want to lift my arms to you.
