All My Days
=
May this life that I live bring You praise,
Blessing You and Your wonderful ways.
In the work of my hands,
   and the words that I say,
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
=
I will sing to Your name when I wake,
Giving thanks for each breath that I take,
From the first light I see,
  to the last pray'r I pray,
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
=
All my days, all my days;
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
All my days, all my days;
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
=
May this life that I live make you glad,
Help me praise You with all that I have.
May the thoughts of my heart
   bring a smile to Your face,
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
=
Ev'ry day is a gift from Your hand,
You're the Author of all that I am.
Let my story be told
  in this heart speken phrase;
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
=
All my days, all my days;
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
All my days, all my days;
I will worship you, Lord, all of my days.
