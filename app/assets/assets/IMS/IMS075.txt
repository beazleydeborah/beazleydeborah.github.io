Jesus, All for Jesus

(verse:IMS 801)

Jesus, All for Jesus,
All I am and have and ever hope to be;
(repeat)


All of my ambitions, hopes and plans
I surrender these into your hands.
(repeat)


For it's only in Your will that I am free,
For it's only in Your will that I am free,
Jesus, All for Jesus,
All I am and have and ever hope to be;
(repeat afer interlude)
