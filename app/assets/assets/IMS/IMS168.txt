Hear our prayer
We are your children
And we've gathered here today
We've gathered here to pray
Hear our cry
Lord we need Your mercy
And we need You peace today
Hear us as we pray
=
Our Father,
Who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Our Father
Hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
=
Hear our song,
As it rises to heaven
May Your glory fill the earth
As the waters cover the sea
See our hearts
And remove anything
That is standing in the way
Of coming to to You today
=
And though we are few
We're sorrounded by many
Who have crossed that river before
And this is the song
We'll be singing forever
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
