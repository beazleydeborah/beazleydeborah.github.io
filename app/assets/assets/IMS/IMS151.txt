title:Where the roses never fade
order:1,2,3,2,4,2
=
I am going to a city,
Where the streets with gold are laid;
Where the tree of life is blooming
And the roses never fade.
=
Here they bloom but for a season
Soon their beauty is decayed.
I am going to a city,
Where the roses never fade.
=
In this world we have our troubles,
Satan snares we must evade.
We'll be free from all temptations;
Where the roses never fade.
=
Loved ones gone to be with Jesus,
In their robes of white arrayed;
Now are waiting for my coming,
Where the roses never fade.
