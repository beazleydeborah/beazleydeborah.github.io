Lord You Have My Heart
=
Lord You have my heart,
And I will search for Yours;
Jesus take my life and lead me on.
Lord You have my heart,
And I will search for Yours;
Let me be to You a sacrifice.

And I will praise You, Lord;
And I will sing of love come down;
And as You show Your face,
We'll see Your glory here
