O tell of His might,
O sing of His grace,
Whose robe is the light,
Whose canopy space.
His chariots of wrath
The deep thunder clouds form,
And dark is His path
On the wings of the storm.

The earth, with its store
Of wonders untold,
Almighty, Thy pow'r
Hath founded of old;
Hath stablished it fast
By a changeless decree,
And round it hath cast
A mantle, the sea.
=
Thy bountiful care
What tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air,
It shines in the light,
It streams from the hills,
It descends to the plain,
And sweetly distills 
In the dew and the rain.
=
Frail children of dust,
And feeble as frail,
In Thee do we trust,
Nor find Thee to fail;
Thy mercies how tender!
How firm to the end.
Our Maker, Defender, 
Redeemer and Friend.
