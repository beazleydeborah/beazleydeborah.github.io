On that bright and cloudless morning 
when the dead in Christ shall rise, 
and the glory of His resurrection share; 
when His chosen ones shall gather to their 
home beyond the skies, 
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

Let us labor for the Master 
from the dawn till setting sun, 
let us talk of all His wondrous love and care; 
then when all of life is over, 
and our work on earth is done, 
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
