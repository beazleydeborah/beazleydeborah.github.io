Christ Arose
=
Low in the grace He lay--
Jesus my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day--
Jesus my Lord!
=
Up from the grave
   He arose,   (He arose)
With a mighty triumph o're
   His foes;   (He arose!)
He arose a victor from the dark domain,
And He lives forever with His saints to reign.
He arose! (He arose!)  He arose! (He arose!)
Halleluah!  Christ arose!
=
Vainly they watched His bed--
Jesus my Saviour!
Vainly they seal the dead--
Jesus my Lord!

Up from the grave

And He lives forever with His saints to reign.
He arose! (He arose!)  He arose! (He arose!)
Halleluah!  Christ arose!
=
Death cannot keep his prey--
Jesus my Saviour!
He tore the bars away--
Jesus my Lord!
