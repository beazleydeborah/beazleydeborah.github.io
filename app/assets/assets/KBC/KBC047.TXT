D       A       G      A          Bm    A%
For the word of God is living and active
    G            A   D         A%
And sharper than any two-edged sword
G           A            Bm    A%
Piercing as far as the division
   G%
Of soul and spirit
Of both joints and marrow
    G                 A%
And able to judge the thoughts
               D           G-A-D%
And intentions of the heart
