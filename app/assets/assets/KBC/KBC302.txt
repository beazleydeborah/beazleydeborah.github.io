Forever
=
The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon him
=
One final breath he gave
As heaven looked away
The son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken
=
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
his perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting?
Our resurrected King
Has rendered you defeated
=
Forever he is glorified
Forever he is lifted high
Forever he is risen
He is alive, He is alive!
=
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
his perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting?
Our resurrected King
Has rendered you defeated
=
Forever he is glorified
Forever he is lifted high
Forever he is risen
He is alive, He is alive!
=
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
The Lamb has overcome
=
Forever he is glorified
Forever he is lifted high
Forever he is risen
He is alive, He is alive!
