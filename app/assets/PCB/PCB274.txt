I will follow
=
Father, always near, I wait for You here,
Resting in the love that vanquishes fear.
Waiting, not a care, silence ev'rywhere,
Yet here in my heart a still small voice
Bids me to come and I will follow.
=
Suffer me to come, risen, wounded One,
I've found shelter in Your fathering arms.
Suffer me to hear Your voice in my ear
Beckon me with words that draw me near,
Bid me to come and I will follow.
=
I will follow You where You want me to.
I will follow You.
=
May Your Kingdom come, may Your will be done,
Father in Heaven, lift my eyes to the sky.
One day I will see Heaven's Royalty,
Till the day the trumpet rings in my ear.
Bid me to come and I will follow.
