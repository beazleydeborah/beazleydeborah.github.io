Even Now
=
Jesus, Lord of Heaven,
  the One who shall endure;
Everlasting, ever faithful, ever pure.
I know that I will see You,
  I believe that it is true
That in Heaven's joy I'll be there close to You.
=
How I long to see You, even now.
May my eyes be open, even now.
=
Jesus, Son of David, send Your holy light;
Let me feel the warmth of Heaven deep inside.
May a vision of Your glory flood my point of view
As in faith I bow in prayer and look to You.
