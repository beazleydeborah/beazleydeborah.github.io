You Are Holy

You raised the mountains up and laid the
   valleys low.
You lift the humble heart and break the
   prideful soul.
You chase the darkness from my life,
Lord, You make me whole.

You are holy, Holy is the Lord.
You are holy, Holy is the Lord.
You are holy, holy, Holy is the Lord.

In Your power and Your glory I can see
The God of love and grace who's reaching
   out to me.
I've been made righteous by Your blood,
Lord, You've set me free.

You are holy, Holy is the Lord.
You are holy, Holy is the Lord.
You are holy, holy, Holy is the Lord.
