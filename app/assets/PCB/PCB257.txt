Sole Desire
=
Chorus:
Your'e the sole desire of my heart.
You're the sole desire of my heart.
=
Still more with ev'ry passing day,
As things of earth just fade away,
I come to know the joy of loving You.
You're the sole desire of my heart.
=
Lord, speak to me, I'm standing still,
I come to hear, reveal Your will,
I'll listen to Your voice and then obey.
Your're the sole desire of my heart.
