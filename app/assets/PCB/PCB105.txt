Come, Let Us Worship And Bow Down
=
Come, let us worship and bow down
Let us kneel before the Lord, our God, our Maker
Come, let us worship and bow down 
Let us kneel before the Lord, our God, our Maker;

For He is our God,
And we are the people of His pasture,
And the sheep of His hand,
Just the sheep of His hand.
