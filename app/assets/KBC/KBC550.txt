Memory passage

Psalm 127

Unless the Lord builds the house,
they labor in vain who build it
Unless the lord guards the city,
The watchman keeps awake in vain

It is vain for you to rise up early,
To retire late,
To eat the bread of painful labors
For He gives to His beloved [even in
   his] sleep.
=
Behold, children are a gift of the
   Lord
The fruit of the womb is a reward.

Like arrows in the hand of a
   warrior,
So are the children of one's youth.
=
How blessed is the man whose
   quiver is full of them;
They will not be ashamed
When they speak with their enemies
   in the gate.
