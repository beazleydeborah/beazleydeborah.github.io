  Your Burden is Mine by Sarah Sparks
=
Don't hold your tears back from me, 
and I'll give you Mine, and I'll give you Mine 
Don't spare me from anything, your burden is Mine,
Your burden is Mine

Careful my brother, there on your own, 
For it is a fool who suffers alone,
there's none self sufficient, only those who try,
so swallow your pride, your burden is Mine.
