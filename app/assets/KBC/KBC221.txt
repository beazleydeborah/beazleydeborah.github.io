Sanctuary
=
Lord prepare me, to be a sanctuary
Pure and holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving, I'll be a living
Sanctuary for you
=
It is you Lord, who came to save the
Heart and soul of, every man
It is you Lord, who knows my weakness
Gives me strength with, Thine own hand
=
Lead me on Lord, from temptation
Purify me, from within
Fill my heart with, your Holy Spirit
Take away, all my sin
