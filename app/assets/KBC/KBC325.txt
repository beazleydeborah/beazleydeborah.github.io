Psalm 1:1-3
order:1,2,3,2
=
How blessed is the man who
Does not walk
In the counsel of the wicked,
Nor stand in the path of sinners,
Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
=
And in His law
he meditates day and night.
And in His law
he meditates day and night.
=
He will be like a tree firmly planted
by streams of water,
Which yields its fruit in its season
And its leaf does not wither;
And in whatever he does, he prospers.
