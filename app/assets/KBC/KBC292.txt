He made the Stars to Shine
=
He made the stars to shine
(twinkle, twinkle)
He made the rolling sea
(splish, splash)
He made the mountains high
(so high)
And He made me
(thumpity, thumpity, thumpity, thump)
And that is why I love Him
For me he bled and died
The Lord of all creation
Became the crucified.
