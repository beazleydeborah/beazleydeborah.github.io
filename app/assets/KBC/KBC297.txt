Amazing Grace
=
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Yippee-kai-yay, yippee-kai-yo
That saved a wretch like me
=
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Yippee-kai-yay, yippee-kai-yo
That saved a wretch like me
=
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
`Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

Yippee-kai-yay, yippee-kai-yo
That saved a wretch like me
=
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's grace
Then when we first begun

Yippee-kai-yay, yippee-kai-yo
That saved a wretch like me
