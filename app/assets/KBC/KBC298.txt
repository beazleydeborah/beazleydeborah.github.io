Malachi 4:2-3
=
But for you who fear my name
The sun of righteousness will rise
with healing in its wings;
and you shall go forth again
and skip about like calves
coming from their stalls at last
=
You shall be my very own
On the day that I 
cause you to be my special home
I shall spare you as a man
has compassion on his son
who does the best he can
=
But for you who fear my name
The sun of righteousness will rise
with healing in its wings;
and you shall go forth again
and skip about like calves
coming from their stalls at last
=
You shall be my very own
On the day that I 
cause you to be my special home
I shall spare you as a man
has compassion on his son
who does the best he can
=
But for you who fear my name
The sun of righteousness will rise
with healing in its wings;
and you shall go forth again
and skip about like calves
coming from their stalls at last
