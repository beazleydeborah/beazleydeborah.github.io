Joel 2:11-13
order:1,2,3,2
=
The Lord utters His voice before His army; 
Surely His camp is very great, 
For strong is he who carries out His word. 
The day of the Lord is indeed great
and very awesome,
And who can endure it? 
=
Yet even now, declares the Lord, 
Return to Me with all your heart, 
And with fasting, weeping and mourning; 
Yet even now, declares the Lord, 
Return to Me with all your heart, 
And rend your heart and not your garments." 
=
Now return to the Lord your God, 
For He is gracious and compassionate, 
Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness 
And relenting of evil.
