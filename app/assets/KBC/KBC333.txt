Drawn To The Cross Which You Have Blessed 
order:1,2,3,4
=
Drawn to the Cross which You have blessed,
With healing gifts for souls distressed, 
To find in You my Life, my Rest, 
Christ crucified, I come.
Stained with the sins which I have wrought, 
In word and deed and secret thought; 
For pardon which Your Blood has bought,
Christ crucified, I come.
=
Weary of selfishness and pride, 
False pleasures gone, vain hopes denied, 
Deep in Your wounds my shame to hide, 
Christ crucified, I come.
You know all my griefs and fears,
Your grace abused, my misspent years;
Yet now to You for cleansing tears,
Christ crucified, I come.
=
I would not, if I could conceal
The ills which only You can heal;
So to the Cross, where sinners kneel,
Christ crucified, I come.
Wash me, and take away each stain, 
Let nothing of my sin remain;
For cleansing, though it be through pain,
Christ crucified, I come.
=
To share with You Your life divine,
Your very likeness to be mine,
Since You have made my nature Thine,
Christ crucified, I come.
To be what You would have me be,
Accepted, sanctified in Thee,
Through what Your grace shall work in me, 
Christ crucified, I come.
