Em                     D     Em%
All we like sheep have gone astray.
                  D              Em%
We've turned everyone to his own way,
        G        D       Em-A%
But the Lord has laid on Him
     Em      D     Em%
The iniquity of us all.

He bore our sorrows and our shame,
   C     D       Em%
He took away our sin.
    C      D         Em%
And He has healed us by His stripes,
    C             F - D%
And made us whole again.
