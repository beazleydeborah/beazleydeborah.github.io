  C    G  Am               F    G  C%
Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. 
(repeat)
            F%
Just as the branch 
            G          C%
Cannot bear fruit by itself
            F     c      G%
Unless it remains in the vine
           F   G     C%
So neither can you unless you 
  Am      F     G       C%
Remain in Me, remain in Me

C G      Am%
I am the vine
                F G C%
And you are the branches
(repeat)
              F     G  C%
The one who remains in me
             F     C    G%
And I in him bears much fruit
         F    G    C%
Because apart from me
          Am       F%
You can accomplish nothing
  G        C%
Accomplish nothing
