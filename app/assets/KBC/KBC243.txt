The Countdown Song
=
Somewhere in outer space
God has prepared a place
For those who trust Him and obey
Jesus will come again
And though we don't know when
The countdown's getting lower every day
10 and 9, 8 and 7
6 and 5 and 4
Call upon the Savior while you may
3 and 2 coming through the clouds
In bright array
The countdown's getting lower every day
