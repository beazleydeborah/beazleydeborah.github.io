Hawkinlandia

Tune is Hawkinlandia

Oh, Hawkinland, our beloved country,
Where yellow rules our future as our past
Bananas, lemons, sunshine, rubber duckies
Even our sky glows with a yellow cast
=
Each happy face, the juice at lunch on Monday,
Corn on the cob, and every caution sign,
Come visit us where every day’s a fun day
At every meal on scrambled eggs we dine.
=
We’re Hawkinland, please gather round to hear us
Our farms are large, and all our cows say “Moo”
And though it’s said that even pirates fear us,
We’ll tell that you we’re yellow through and through
=
Oh, Hawkinland, where streams flow mellow-yellow
We oft unite to climb our Mt. Dew
Will you defect, tell team-mates “Cheerio”
And join with us, be yellow thru and thru?
