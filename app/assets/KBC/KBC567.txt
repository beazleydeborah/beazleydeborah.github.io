10For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, 
so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, 
according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
 
11Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, 
we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; 
and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences. 

12We are not again commending ourselves to you 
but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, 
so that you will have an answer for those 
who take pride in appearance and not in heart. 

13For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; 
if we are of sound mind, it is for you. 
=
14For the love of Christ controls us, 
having concluded this, that one died for all, 
therefore all died; 

15and He died for all, 
so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, 
but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf. 

16Therefore from now on we recognize 
no one according to the flesh; 
even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, 
yet now we know Him in this way no longer. 
=
17Therefore if anyone is in Christ, 
he is a new creature; the old things passed away; 
behold, new things have come. 

18Now all these things are from God, 
who reconciled us to Himself through Christ 
and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, 

19namely, that God was in Christ 
reconciling the world to Himself, 
not counting their trespasses against them, 
and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.

20Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, 
as though God were making an appeal through us; 
we beg you on behalf of Christ, 
be reconciled to God. 
=
21He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, 
so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
