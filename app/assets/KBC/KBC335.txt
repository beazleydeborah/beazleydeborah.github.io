E                                A%
Therefore since we are surrounded
			 E%
By such a great cloud of witnesses
                                 B%
Let us throw off everything that hinders
                             E%
And the sin that so easily entagles
                           A%
And let us run with perserverence
The race marked out for us
Fixing our eyes on Jesus
     B%
The pioneer and perfecter of faith
E%
For the joy set before Him
A%
He endured the cross 
F#%
Scorning its shame
     B               A%
And sat down at the right hand
                  E%
Of the throne of God
