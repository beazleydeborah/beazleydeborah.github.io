For me, to live is Christ, to die is gain.
            A7                       D%
To hold His hand and walk the narrow way;
                               D7%
There is no peace, no joy, no thrill,
      G             Gm%
Like walking in His will.
             D        A7              D-G-D%
For me, to live is Christ, to die is gain!
