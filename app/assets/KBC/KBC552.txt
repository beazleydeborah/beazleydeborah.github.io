SIXTEEN GALLONS
=
I was lured into buying this SUV
with incentives & gimmicks &
gadgetry
Now it's parked in my driveway,
I walk everywhere
I was Macho Man but now I'm a 
square
=
Just 16 gallons, and what 
do you get,
another day older and 
deeper in debt,
St. Peter don't you call me
'cause I can't go -
I owe my soul to AMOCO.
=
Got a credit card, but maxed
it out,
got another one, but that 
went south,
I owe CITI bank, and UMB
US bank has my liberty.
=
Just 16 gallons, and what 
do you get,
another day older and 
deeper in debt,
St. Peter don't you call me
'cause I can't go -
I owe my soul to AMOCO.
=
With $2.00 beans 
and $3.00 bread
$4.00 gas 
and $5.00 spread
$6.00 chuck 
and $7.00 steak
$8.00 lettuce - 
Hey, give me a break!

Just 16 gallons, and what 
do you get,
another day older and 
deeper in debt,
St. Peter don't you call me
