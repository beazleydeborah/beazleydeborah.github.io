Billions of Dead Things
=
The Bible talks about Noah and the Ark,
And the world-wide flood
   where the world was judged.
If there really was a world-wide flood,
what would the evidence be?
=
Billions of dead things,
Buried in rock layers,
Laid down by water,
All over the earth.
(repeat)
=
Well, there really was a world-wide flood,
Just look at the stony curse.
With billions of dead things,
Buried in rock layers,
Laid down by water,
All over the earth.
=
The Bible talks about a world-wide flood.
Could the fossils be the proof we see?
If there really was a world-wide flood
What would the evidence be?
=
Billions of dead things,
Buried in rock layers,
Laid down by water,
All over the earth.

Just look at the stony curse.
With billions of dead things,
Buried in rock layers,
Laid down by water,
All over the earth.
