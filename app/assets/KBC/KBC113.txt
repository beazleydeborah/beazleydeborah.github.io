Psalm 19:7-10
=
The law of the Lord is perfect
Restoring the soul
The testimony of the Lord is sure
Making wise the simple
=
They are more desirable than gold
Yes, than much fine gold
Sweeter also than honey
And the drippings of the honeycomb
=
The precepts of the Lord are right
Rejoicing the heart
The commandment of the Lord is pure
Enlightening the eyes
=
They are more desirable than gold
Yes, than much fine gold
Sweeter also than honey
And the drippings of the honeycomb
=
The fear of the Lord is clean
Enduring forever
The judgements of the Lord are true
They are righteous altogether
=
They are more desirable than gold
Yes, than much fine gold
Sweeter also than honey
And the drippings of the honeycomb
