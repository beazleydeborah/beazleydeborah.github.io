Revelation 12:11
=
 D            Em%      
They have overcome him
         A           D%
By the blood of the Lamb.
(repeat)

D          G             F#m%
And by the word of their testimony,
         Bm                      G%
They did not love their lives so much
      G-A          B%
As to shrink from death.
(repeat first verse twice)
