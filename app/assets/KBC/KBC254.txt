Ephesians 6:10-12
=
Finally, be strong in the Lord
and in the strength of His might. 
Put on the full armor of God,
so that you will be
able to stand firm against
the schemes of the devil. 
=
For our struggle
is not against flesh and blood,
but against the rulers,
against the powers,
against the world forces
of this darkness,
against the spiritual
forces of wickedness
in the heavenly places.
