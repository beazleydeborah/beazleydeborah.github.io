The Work Song
=
We must work the works
   of Him who sent us
As long as it is day;
We must work the works
   of Him who sent us
As long as it is day;
Night is coming,
When no man can work.
=
The harvest is plentiful,
But the laborers are few.
Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest
To send out workers into His harvest.
=
Truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me,
The works that I do shall he do also;
And greater works than these shall he do;
That the Father may be glorified
in the Son... the Son... the Son.
=
We must work the works
   of Him who sent us
As long as it is day;
We must work the works
   of Him who sent us
As long as it is day;
Night is coming,
When no man can work.
=
Therefore my beloved brethren,
Be steadfast, immovable,
Always abounding in the work of the Lord,
knowing that your toil is not in vain
In the Lord.
=
Truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me,
The works that I do shall he do also;
And greater works than these shall he do;
That the Father may be glorified
In the Son... the Son... the Son.
=
We must work the works
   of Him who sent us
As long as it is day.
We must work the works
   of Him who sent us
As long as it is day.
Night is coming,
When no man can work.
