God was by my side each step
And quietly we talked
Then on the sky my life was flashed
And visions all serene
Two sets of footprints in the sand
Were there in every scene

My precious child
God said to me
Each time your life has pain
I'll know
Whenever you're to broken to walk
I'll be there to carry you

Then I noticed in some times
Of suffering, pain and strife
A single set of footprints
At the worst times of my life
Oh God you said you'd stay by me
In good times and in bad
Why then did you leave me
Each time my life was sad?

My precious child
God answered
Each time your life had pain I knew
The single set of footprints
Were the times I carried you

The single set of footprints
Were the times I carried you

I'll always be there to carry you
