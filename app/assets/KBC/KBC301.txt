Come, my soul, thou must be waking
=
Come, my soul, thou must be waking,
Now is breaking
O'er the earth another day:
Come, to Him Who made this splendor
See thou render
All thy feeble strength can pay.
=
Gladly hail the sun returning:
Ready burning
Be the incense of Thy powers:
For the night is safely ended;
God hath tended
With His care thy helpless hours.
=
Pray that He may prosper ever
Each endeavor,
When thine aim is good and true;
But that He may ever thwart thee,
And convert thee,
When thou evil wouldst pursue.
=
Think that He thy ways beholdeth,
He unfoldeth 
Every fault that lurks within;
He the hidden shame glossed over
Can discover,
And discern each deed of sin.
=
Mayest thou on life's last morrow.
Free from sorrow,
Pass away in slumbers sweet;
And, released from death's dark sadness,
Rise in gladness,
That far brighter Sun to greet.
=
Only God's free gift abuse not,
Light refuse not,
But His Spirit's voice obey;
Thou with Him shall dwell, beholding
Light enfolding
All things in unclouded day.
=
Glory, honor, exaltation,
Adoration,
Be to the eternal One:
To the Father, Son, and Spirit
laud and merit,
While unending ages run.
