Jesus is Our Shepherd
=
Jesus is Our Shepherd,
Wiping every tear
Folded in His bosom,
What have we to fear?
Only let us follow
Wither He doth lead
To the thirsty desert
Or the dewy mead
=
Jesus is Our Shepherd,
Well we know his voice
How its gentle whisper
Makes our hearts rejoice
Even when he chideth
Tender is His tone
None but He shall guide us
We are His alone
=
Jesus is Our Shepherd
For the sheep He bled
Every lamb is sprinkled
With the blood He shed
Then on each setteth
His own secret sign
They that have no spirit
These saith He are mine
=
Jesus is our shepherd
Guarded by His arm
Though the wolves may raven
None can do us harm
When we tread death's valley
Dark with fearful gloom
We will fear no evil
Victors o'er the tomb
