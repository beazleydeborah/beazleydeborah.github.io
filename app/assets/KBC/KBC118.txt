Sing praise to the Lord
        Esus  E%
You His Godly ones
         C                  Esus  E%
And give thanks to His holy name
(repeat)

For His anger is but for a moment
   Bm                    C#m%
Weeping may last for the night
        Bm       C#m%
But his favor is for a lifetime
      D%
And a shout of joy
E                    A     (Bm-C#m-Bm)%
Comes in the morning light
