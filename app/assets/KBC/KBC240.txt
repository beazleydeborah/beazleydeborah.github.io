Romans 11: 33-36
=
Oh the depth of the riches of 
the wisdom and knowledge of God
How unsearchable His judgments,
how unknowable His ways
=
Who knows the mind of our God, 
and who can bring counsel to Him?
Who has given to God
that God should repay?
=
For from Him, through Him,
to Him is everything
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever amen
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever amen
