Mark 12:30-31, I John 4:19
=
And you shall love the Lord
Your God with all your heart
And with all your soul
And with all your mind
And with all your strength ...
And you shall love your neighbor as yourself

We love because He first loved us
   (First loved us)
We love because He first loved us
   (First loved us)
