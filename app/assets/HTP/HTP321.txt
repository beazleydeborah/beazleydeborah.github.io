Love Found a Way
=
Wonderful love that rescued me,
Sunk deep in sin,
Guilty and vile as I could be--
No hope within;
When ev'ry ray of light had fled,
O glorious day!
Raising my soul from our the dead,
Love found a way.

Love found a way   (a way)
To redeem my soul,
   (to redeem my soul)

Love found a way   (a way)
That could make me whole;
   (That could make me whole)

Love sent my Lord   (my Lord)
To the cross of shame,
   (To the cross of shame)

Love found a way,
O praise His holy name!
=
Love bro't my Saviour here to die
On Calvary,
For such a sinful wretch as I,
How can it be?
Love bridged the gulf, twixt me and heav'n
Taught me to pray;
I am redeemed, set free forgiven,
Love found a way.

Love opened wide the gates of light
To heav'n's domain,
Where in eternal pow'r and might
Jesus shall reign;
Love lifted me from depths of woe
To endless day,
There was no help on earth below,
Love found a way.
