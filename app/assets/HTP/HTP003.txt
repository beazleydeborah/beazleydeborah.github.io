To God Be the Glory

To God be the glory,
Great things He hath done,
So loved He the world
That He gave us His Son,
Who yielded Hid life
An atonement for sin,
And opened the Lifegate
That all may go in.
=
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father
Thro' Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory,
Great things He hath done.
=
O perfect redemption,
The purchase of blood,
To ev'ry believer
The promise of God;
The vilest offender
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus
A pardon receives.
=
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father
Thro' Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory,
Great things He hath done.
=
Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing
Thro' Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher,
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport,
When Jesus we see.
=
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father
Thro' Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory,
Great things He hath done.
