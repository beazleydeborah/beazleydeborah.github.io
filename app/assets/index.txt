Now it catches the gleam Of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected, Now shines on the stream: Tis the star-spangled banner; Oh, long may it wave O'er the land of the free, And the home of the brave. And where is that band, Who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war And the battle's confusion, A home and a country Should leave us no more? Their blood has washed out Their foul footsteps' pollution; No refuge could save The hireling and slave From the terror of flight Or the gloom of the grave. And the star-spangled banner In triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free, And the home of the brave.|KBC-44

Aye lover he was of brawny men, O' ships and the open sea. When they came wi' a host to take Our Man His smile was good to see, First let these go!" quo' our Goodly Fere, Or I'll see ye damned," says he. Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears And the scorn of his laugh rang free, Why took ye not me when I walked about Alone in the town?" says he. Oh we drank his "Hale" in the good red wine When we last made company, No capon priest was the Goodly Fere But a man o' men was he. I ha' seen him drive a hundred men Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free, That they took the high and holy house For their pawn and treasury. They'll no' get him a' in a book I think Though they write it cunningly; No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere But aye loved the open sea. If they think they ha' snared our Goodly Fere They are fools to the last degree. I'll go to the feast," quo' our Goodly Fere, Though I go to the gallows tree." Ye ha' seen me heal the lame and blind, And wake the dead," says he, Ye shall see one thing to master all: Tis how a brave man dies on the tree." A son of God was the Goodly Fere That bade us his brothers be. I ha' seen him cow a thousand men. I have seen him upon the tree. He cried no cry when they drave the nails And the blood gushed hot and free, The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue But never a cry cried he. I ha' seen him cow a thousand men On the hills o' Galilee, They whined as he walked out calm between, Wi' his eyes like the grey o' the sea, Like the sea that brooks no voyaging With the winds unleashed and free, Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret Wi' twey words spoke' suddently. A master of men was the Goodly Fere, A mate of the wind and sea, If they think they ha' slain our Goodly Fere They are fools eternally. I ha' seen him eat o' the honey-comb Sin' they nailed him to the tree.|KBC-268

english|1 Peter||Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God’s elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls. Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things. Since you call on a Father who judges each person’s work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear. For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, 19 but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God. Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart. For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. For, “All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word that was preached to you. Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him— you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house[a] to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in Scripture it says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.” Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,” and, “A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.” They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for. But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. 13 Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves. Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor. 18 Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. “He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.” When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats.

For God did not send His son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world But men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God"|IMS-316

You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross. God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible, not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead. Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.”|IMS-317

The Babe in the manger could never have done the work of His God on high, The Babe left the manger and went to the Cross to pay the wages of sin. Your way of forgiveness is not by the Babe, But the Christ who died for your sin. If you worship the Babe in the manger, But ignore the blood of God's Son, To you Christ is only a stranger Til you trust the work He has done.

Your way of forgiveness is not by the Babe, But the Christ who died for your sin. Will you look past the Babe in the manger? Will you look to Calvary? Oh my friend can you see the danger Of a lost eternity. The Babe in the manger was God's only Son, Who came to the world to die.

english|The First Noel||The first Noel the angel did say Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay; In fields where they lay tending their sheep, On a cold winter's night that was so deep. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, Born is the King of Israel. They looked up and saw a star Shining in the east, beyond them far; And to the earth it gave great light, And so it continued both day and night. And by the light of that same star Three Wise Men came from country far; To seek for a King was their intent, And to follow the star wherever it went. This star drew nigh to the northwest, Over Bethlehem it took its rest; And there it did both stop and stay, Right over the place where Jesus lay. Then did they know assuredly Within that house the King did lie; One entered it them for to see, And found the Babe in poverty. Then entered in those Wise Men three, Full reverently upon the knee, And offered there, in His presence, Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. Between an ox stall and an ass, This Child truly there He was; For want of clothing they did Him lay All in a manger, among the hay. Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord; That hath made heaven and earth of naught, And with His blood mankind hath bought. If we in our time shall do well, We shall be free from death and hell; For God hath prepared for us all A resting place in general.|IMS-705

Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. 24 “He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.” 25 For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. .|IMS-997

O tell of His might, O sing of His grace, Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space. His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form, And dark is His path on the wings of the storm. The earth, with its store of wonders untold, Almighty, Thy pow'r hath founded of old; Hath stablished it fast by a changeless decree, And round it hath cast a mantle, the sea. Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, it shines in the light, It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain. Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail; Thy mercies how tender! How firm to the end. Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.|HGC-139

So send I you to loneliness and longing with heart ahung'ring for the loved and known, forsaking home and kindred, friend and dear one, so send I you to know My love alone. So send I you to leave your lif'e ambition, To die to dear desire, selfwill resign, To labor long and love where men revile you, So send I you to lose your life in Mine.

As the Father hath sent me, so send I you."|HGC-140

But "I know Whom I have believed, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day."|HGC-270

It was on the Cross He shed His blood, It was there He was crucified; But He rose again, and lives in my heart, Where all is peace and perfect love. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, Save in the death of Christ my God! All the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to His blood. It was on the Cross He shed His blood, It was there He was crucified; But He rose again, and lives in my heart, Where all is peace and perfect love. See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love flow mingled down! Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, Or thorns compose so rich a crown? It was on the Cross He shed His blood, It was there He was crucified; But He rose again, and lives in my heart, Where all is peace and perfect love. Were the whole realm of nature mine, That were an offering far too small: Love so amazing, so divine, Demands my heart, my life, my all. It was on the Cross He shed His blood, It was there He was crucified; But He rose again, and lives in my heart, Where all is peace and perfect love.|HTP-254

Oh, the grace the brought me to the fold, Wonderous grace that brought me to the fold! He washed the bleeding sin-wounds, And poured in oil and wine; He whispered to assure me, I've found thee, thou art mine;" I never heard a sweeter voice; It made my aching heart rejoice! Oh, the love that sought me! Oh, the blood that bought me! Oh, the grace the brought me to the fold, Wonderous grace that brought me to the fold!

Oh, the blood that bought me! Oh, the grace the brought me to the fold, Wonderous grace that brought me to the fold!

Christ Jesus, it is He, Lord Sabaoth, His name, From age to age the same, And He must win the battle. And though this world, with devils filled, Should threaten to undo us, We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us: The Prince of Darkness grim-- We tremble not for him; His rage we can endure, For lo, his doom is sure, One little word shall fell him.
