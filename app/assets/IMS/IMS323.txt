Psalm 23
=
1 The LORD is my shepherd, 
   I shall not be in want.

2 He makes me lie down in green pastures,
   He leads me beside quiet waters,
=
3 He restores my soul. 
  He guides me in paths of righteousness 
  for His name's sake.

4 Even though I walk 
  through the valley of the shadow of death, 
  I will fear no evil, for you are with me; 
  your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
=
5 You prepare a table before me 
   in the presence of my enemies. 
  You anoint my head with oil; 
  my cup overflows.

6 Surely goodness and love will follow me 
  all the days of my life, 
  and I will dwell in the house of the LORD 
  forever.
