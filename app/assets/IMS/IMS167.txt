May the Lord protect and defend you, 
May he always shield you from shame

May you be deserving of praise, 
Strengthen us, oh Lord,
And keep us in Messiah's ways.

May God make you good husbands and wives, 
(May He send you husbands who will care for you).

May the Lord preserve you from pain 
Favor us, oh Lord, with happiness and peace, 
Oh hear our Sabbath prayer.
Amen.
