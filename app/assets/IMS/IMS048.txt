D        A       G      A           D%
For the word of God is living and active
      G               Em         D%
And sharper than any two-edged sword
G                       D%
Piercing as far as the division
   Em%
Of soul and spirit
   Em%
Of both joints and marrow
    G                   A%
And able to judge the thoughts
               D         G  A  D%
And intentions of the heart
