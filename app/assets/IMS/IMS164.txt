title:Who You Are
order:1;2
=
Shine Your light
Into the dark
Speak Your truth
Into my heart
I want to know who You are
=
Open my eyes, so I can see You
Open my ears, so I can hear You
I give my hear to You, Lord
I want to know who You are
I want to know who You are
Please show me
Open my eyes, Lord
