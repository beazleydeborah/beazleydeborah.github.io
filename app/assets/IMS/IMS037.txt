John 10:27

D%
My sheep hear My voice
        A                        D%
And I know them and they follow Me
        G              D%
And I give unto them eternal life;
     E                 A%
And they shall never perish,
A%
Neither shall any man
                      D%
Pluck them out of My hand.
