All along my pilgrim journey,
Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me.

In my trials, Lord, walk with me.
In my trials, Lord walk with me.
When my heart is almost breaking,
Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me.

When I'm in trouble, Lord, walk with me.
When I'm in trouble, Lord, walk with me.
When my head is bowed in sorrow,
Lord, I want Jesus to walk with me.
