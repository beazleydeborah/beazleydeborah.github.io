title:Blessed Redeemer
order:1,2,3,2,4,2
=
Up Calv'ry's mountain, one dreadful morn,
Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn,
Facing for sinner death on the cross
That He might save them from endless loss.
=
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer!
Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree,
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading--
Blind and unheeding--dying for me
=
"Father, forgive them!" thus did He pray,
E'en while His life-blood flowed fast away,
Praying for sinners while in such woe--
No one but Jesus ever loved so.
=
O how I love Him, Savior and frind!
How can my praises ever find end!
Thru years unnumbered on heaven's shore,
My tongue shall praise Him forever more.
