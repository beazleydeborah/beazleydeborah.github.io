None But Jesus
Order: 1,2,3,4,2,3,5,3
=
In the quiet
In the stillness
I know that you are God
In the secret of your presence
I know there I am restored
=
So when you call, I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose
=
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise
=
In the chaos
And confusion
I know you're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me strength to do Your will
=
All my delight is in you Lord
All of my hope, all of my strength
All my delight is in you Lord
Forever more
