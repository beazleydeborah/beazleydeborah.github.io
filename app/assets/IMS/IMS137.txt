Just Let Me Say
=
Just let me say how much I love You
Let me speak of your mercy and grace
Just let me live in the shadow of your beauty
Let me see You face to face
And the earth will shake as your Word goes forth
And the heavens can tremble and fall
But let me say how much I love You,
O my Savior, my Lord and Friend
=
Just let me hear your finest whispers
As you gently call my name
And let me see your power and your glory
Let me feel your Spirit's flame
Let me find you in the desert
'Til this sand is holy ground
And I am found completely surrendered
To you, my Lord and Friend.
=
So let me say how much I love you
With all my heart I long for you
For I am caught in this passion of knowing
This endless love I've found in you
And the depth of grace, the forgiveness found,
To be called a child of God
Just makes me say how much I love you,
O my Savior, my Lord and Friend
Just makes me say how much I love you,
O my Savior, my Lord and Friend.
