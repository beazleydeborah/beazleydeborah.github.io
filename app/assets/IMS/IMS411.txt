Hodeeyáádą́ą́' Diyin God 
yót'ááh hiníláii

=
In the beginning 
God created the heavens and the earth.
Now the earth was formless and empty,
Darkness was over the surface of the deep,
And the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters
=
And God said, "Let there be light" 
and there was light.
God called the light DAY
And the darkness He called NIGHT
And there was evening and there was morning--
The first day.
