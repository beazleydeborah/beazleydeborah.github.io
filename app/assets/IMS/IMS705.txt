The First Noel
order:1,2,3,2,4,2,7,2
=
The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
   in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay tending their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
=
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.
=
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
=
And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
=
This star drew nigh to the northwest,
Over Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
=
Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie;
One entered it them for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty.
=
Then entered in those Wise Men three,
Full reverently upon the knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
=
Between an ox stall and an ass,
This Child truly there He was;
For want of clothing they did Him lay
All in a manger, among the hay.
=
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.
=
If we in our time shall do well,
We shall be free from death and hell;
For God hath prepared for us all
A resting place in general.
