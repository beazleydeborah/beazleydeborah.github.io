Acts 10:34-45
topic:memory
=
Opening his mouth, Peter said: 
“I most certainly understand now 
that God is not one to show partiality, 
but in every nation the man who fears Him
and does what is right is welcome to Him. 
=
The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, 
preaching peace through Jesus Christ 
(He is Lord of all)
— you yourselves know the thing which took place 
throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, 
after the baptism which John proclaimed. 
=
You know of Jesus of Nazareth, 
how God anointed Him 
with the Holy Spirit 
and with power, 
and how He went about doing good
and healing 
all who were oppressed by the devil, 
for God was with Him. 
=
We are witnesses of all the things He did 
both in the land of the Jews 
and in Jerusalem. 
They also put Him to death 
by hanging Him on a cross. 
=
God raised Him up on the third day 
and granted that He become visible, 
not to all the people, 
but to witnesses 
who were chosen beforehand by God, 
that is, to us who ate and drank with Him 
after He arose from the dead. 
=
And He ordered us to preach to the people, 
and solemnly to testify 
that this is the One 
who has been appointed by God 
as Judge of the living and the dead. 
Of Him all the prophets bear witness 
that through His name 
everyone who believes in Him 
receives forgiveness of sins.”
