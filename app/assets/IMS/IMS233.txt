God forgave my sin in Jesus' name,
I've been born again in Jesus' name.
And in Jesus' name I come to you,
To share His love as He told me to.

Freely, freely give.
Go in my name, and because you believe,
Others will know that I live."

In earth and heav'n in Jesus' name.

To share His power as He told me to.
