John 17:13-17
=
But now I come to You; and these things 
I speak in the world so that they may have 
My joy made full in themselves. 
I have given them Your word; 
and the world has hated them, because they are 
not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
I do not ask You to take them out of the world, 
but to keep them from the evil one. 
They are not of the world, 
even as I am not of the world. 
Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."
