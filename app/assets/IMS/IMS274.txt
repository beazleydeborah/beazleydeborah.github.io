D                  A        Bm%
Have this attitude in yourselves
          G                 A% 
Which was also in Christ Jesus,
D                  A      D      G       A% 
Who, although He existed in the form of God,
    Bm                      F#m% 
Did not regard equality with God 
                G%
A thing to be grasped, 
      A%
But emptied Himself, 
Bm                   F#m%
Taking the form of a bond-servant, 
           G                       A%
And being made in the likeness of men.

Being found in appearance as a man, 
     G                   A% 
He humbled Himself by becoming obedient 
D                 A           D        G - A%
To the point of death, even death on a cross. 
Bm                     F#m%
For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, 
G%
And bestowed on Him 
     G               A          D%
The name which is  above every name,
                A                   G         A%
So that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow,
    Bm% 
Of those who are in heaven 
        F#m                  G%
And on earth and under the earth, 
And that every tongue will confess that

To the glory of God the Father.
