Tree Song

I saw a tree by the riverside 
one day as I walked along,
Straight as an arrow and pointing to the sky, 
Growing tall and strong.
'How do you grow so tall and strong?'
I said to the riverside tree,
This is the song that my tree friend sang to me.
=
I've got roots growing down to the water,
I've got leaves growing up to the sunshine,
And the fruit that I bear is a sign of the life in me.
I am shade from the hot summer sundown,
I am nest for the birds of the heaven,
I'm becoming what the Lord of the trees 
   has meant me to be,
A strong young tree.
=
I saw a tree in the wintertime 
when snow lay on the ground, 
Straight as an arrow and pointing to the sky,
And winter winds blew all around.
'How do you stay so tall and strong?' 
I said to the wintertime tree,
This is the song that my tree friend sang to me.
=
I saw a tree in the city streets 
Where buildings blocked the sun,
Green and lovely I could see 
it gave joy to everyone.
'How do you grow in the city streets?'
I said to the downtown tree,
This is the song that my tree friend sang to me.
