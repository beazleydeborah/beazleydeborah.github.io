John 17:18-21

"As You sent Me into the world, 
I also have sent them into the world. 
For their sakes I sanctify Myself, 
that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. 
I do not ask on behalf of these alone, 
but for those also who believe in Me through their word; 
that they may all be one; even as You, 
Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, 
so that the world may believe that You sent Me."
