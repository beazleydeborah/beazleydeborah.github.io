O Come Little Children

O come little children
O come one and all
O come to the manger
In Bethlehem's stall,
And see the Lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay,
The little Lord Jesus
Was born Christmas Day.
=
Now "Glory to God!"
Comes the song from on high.
And "Peace for all mankind"
We sing in reply,
Then come little children,
Be happy all day
For Jesus, the Christ Child,
Was born Christmas Day.
