O the deep, deep love of Jesus; 
spread His praise from shore to shore; 
how He loveth, ever loveth, 
changeth never, nevermore; 
how He watches o'er His loved ones, 
died to call them all His own; 
how for them He intercedeth, 
watcheth o'er them from the throne.

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
love of ev'ry love the best; 
'tis an ocean vast of blessing, 
'tis a haven sweet of rest, 
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
'tis a heav'n of heav'ns to me; 
and it lifts me up to glory, 
for it lifts me up to Thee.
