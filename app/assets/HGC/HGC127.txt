O my Savior crucified,
         A     B7    E  B%
Near Thy cross would I abide,

Gazing with adoring eye
E7     A     B7 E%
On Thy dying agony.

Jesus bruis'd and put to shame,
Tells me all Jehovah's name; 
God is love, I surely know 
By the Savior's depths of woe.
=
In His spotless soul's distress 
I have learnt my guiltiness;
O how vile my low estate, 
Since my ransom was so great!
=
Rent the veil that closed the way 
To my home of heav'nly day, 
In the flesh of Christ the Lord, 
Ever be His name adored!
=
Yet in sight of Calvary,
Contrite should my spirit be, 
Rest and holiness there find 
Fashioned like my Savior's mind.
