Christ, by highest heaven adored; 
Christ, the everlasting Lord!
Late in time behold Him come, 
Offspring of the virgin's womb: 
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; 
Hail th' incarnate Deity, 
Pleased as man with men to dwell, 
Jesus, our Emmanuel.

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace.
Hail the Sun of Righteousness. 
Light and life to all He brings, 
Risen with healing in His wings. 
Mild He lays His glory by, 
Born that man no more may die, 
Born to raise the sons of earth, 
Born to give them second birth.
