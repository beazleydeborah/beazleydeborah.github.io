Jesus is the name that charms us; 
He for conflict fits and arms us; 
nothing moves and nothing 
harms us while we trust in Him.

Trust in Him, ye saints, forever;
He is faithful, changing never; 
neither force nor guile can sever 
those He loves from Him.

Keep us Lord, O keep us cleaving
to Thyself and still believing, 
till the hour of our receiving 
promised joys with Thee.

Then we shall be where we would be, 
then we shall be what we should be; 
things that are not now, nor could be, 
soon shall be our own.
