Love bro't my Savior here 
To die on Calvary,
For such a sinful wretch as I,
How can it be?
Love bridged the gulf 
'twixt me and heav'n,
Taught me to pray; I am redeemed, 
Set free, forgiven,
Love found a way.

Love opened wide the gates of light
To heaven's domain, 
Where in eternal power and might
Jesus shall reign;
Love lifted me from depths of woe
To endless day, 
There was no help in earth below,
Love found a way.
