Once earthly joy I craved, 
sought peace and rest;
now Thee alone I seek, 
give what is best;
this all my prayer shall be: 
more love, O Christ, to Thee,
more love to Thee, 
more love to Thee!

Then shall my latest breath 
whisper Thy praise;
this be the parting cry 
my heart shall raise;
this still its prayer shall be: 
more love, O Christ, to Thee, 
more love to Thee, 
more love to Thee!
