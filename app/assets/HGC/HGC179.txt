Yea, "in Thy name," 
O Captain of salvation!
in Thy dear name, 
all other names above; 
Jesus our Righteousness, 
our sure Foundation, 
our Prince of glory 
and our King of love.

"We go" in faith, 
our own great weakness feeling,
and needing more 
each day Thy grace to know:
yet from our hearts 
a song of triumph pealing;
"we rest on Thee, 
and in Thy name we go."

"We rest on Thee" 
our Shield and our Defender!
Thine is the battle, 
Thine shall be the praise.
When passing through
the gates of pearly splendor,
victors - we rest with Thee, 
through endless days.
