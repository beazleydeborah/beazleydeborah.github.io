I take Him at His word indeed: 
"Christ died for sinners,"
this I read; for in my heart I find a need 
of Him to be my Savior!

That He should leave His place 
on high and come for sinful man to die, 
you count it strange? so once did I, 
before I knew my Savior!

And oh, that He fulfilled my see 
the travail of His soul in me,

Yes, living, dying, 
let me bring my strength,
my solace from this spring; 
that He who lives to be my King, 
once died to be my Savior!
