There's a place where sin and shame
Are powerless;
Where my heart has peace with Go
And forgiveness,
Where all the love I've ever found
Comes like a flood,
Comes flowing down.

Here my hope is found,
Here on holy ground,
Here I bow down,
Here I bow down;
Here arms open wide,
Here you saved my life,
Here I bow down,
Here I bow down;
