So send I you to bind the bruised and broken,
O'er wand'ring souls to work, to weep, to wake,
To bear the burdens of a world aweary,
So send I you to suffer for My sake.

So send I you to loneliness and longing
with heartahung'ring for the loved and known, 
forsaking home and kindred, friend and dear one,
So send I you to know My love alone.

So send I you to leave your lif'e ambition,
To die to dear desire, selfwill resign,
To labor long and love where men revile you,
So send I you to lose your life in Mine.

So send I you to hearts made hard by hatred,
to eyes made blind because they will not see,
to spend, tho' it be blood to spend and spare not,
So send I you to taste of Calvary.
