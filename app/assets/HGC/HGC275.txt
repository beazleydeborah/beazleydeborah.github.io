I'VE GOT A RIVER OF LIFE FLOWING
=
Oh, I've got a river of 
life flowing out of me, 
makes the lame to walk 
and the blind to see, 
opens prison doors,
sets the captives free.
Oh, I've got a river of 
life flowing out of me. 
Spring up, oh well, 
within my soul.
Spring up, oh well, 
and make me whole.
Spring up, oh well, 
and give to me that life abundantly.
