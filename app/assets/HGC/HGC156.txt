Take my life, and let it be 
consecrated, Lord to Thee;
take my hands, and let them move 
at the impulse of Thy love, 
at the impulse of Thy love.

Take my feet, and let them be
Wwift and beautiful for Thee;
Take my voice, and let me sing 
Always, only, for my King,
Always, only, for my King.

Take my lips, and let them be 
filled with messages for Thee;
take my silver and my gold, 
not a mite would I withhold,
not a mite would I withhold.

Take my love, my God, I pour
at Thy feet its treasure store;
take myself and I will be 
ever, only, all for Thee, 
ever, only, all for Thee.
