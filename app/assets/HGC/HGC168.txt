There's a wonder of sunset at evening,
the wonder as sunrise I see;
but the wonder of wonders 
that thrills my soul
is the wonder that God loves me.

O the wonder of it all. 
The wonder of it all. 
Just to think that God loves me.

There's the wonder of springtime and harvest, 
the sky, the stars, the sun;
but the wonder of wonders
that thrills my soul
is a wonder that's only begun.
