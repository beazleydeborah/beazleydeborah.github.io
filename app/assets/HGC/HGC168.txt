THE WONDER OF IT ALL

There's a wonder of sunset at evening, the wonder
as sunrise I see; but the wonder of wonders that
thrills my soul is the wonder that God loves me.

O, the wonder of it all. The wonder of it all. 
Just to think that God loves me. O the wonder
of it all. The wonder of it all. Just to think that
God loves me.

There's the wonder of springtime and harvest, 
the sky, the stars, the sun; but the wonder of
wonders that thrills my soul is a wonder that's
only begun.

O, the wonder of it all. The wonder of it all. 
Just to think that God loves me. O the wonder
of it all. The wonder of it all. Just to think that
God loves me.
