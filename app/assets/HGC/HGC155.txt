Sweet hour of pray'r! sweet hour of pray'r, 
the joy I feel, the bliss I share,

and gladly take my station there,
and wait for thee, sweet hour of pray'r.

Sweet hour of pray'r! sweet hour of pray'r, 
thy wings shall my petition bear
to Him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless;
and since He bids me seek His face,
believe His word, and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my ev'ry care,
and wait for thee, sweet hour of pray'r.
