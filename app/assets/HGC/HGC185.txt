When this passing world is done,
          Am        G      C%
when has sunk yon glaring sun,
       C7          F        C% 
when I stand with Christ on high,
        Am          D7   G%
looking o'er life's history:
C                   F     C% 
Then, Lord, shall I fully know -
         Am         G7      C%
not till then - how much I owe.
=
When I stand before the throne,
dressed in beauty not my own;
when I see Thee as Thou art,
loveThee with unsinning heart
Then, Lord, shall I fully know - 
not till then - how much I owe.
=
When the praise of heav'n I hear,
loud as thunder to the ear, 
loud as many waters' noise,
sweet as harp's melodious voice:
Then, Lord, shall I fully know -
not till then - how much I owe.
=
Chosen not for good in me;
wakened up from wrath to flee;
hidden in the Saviour's side;
by the Spirit sanctified:
Teach me, Lord, on earth to show,
by my love, how much I owe.
