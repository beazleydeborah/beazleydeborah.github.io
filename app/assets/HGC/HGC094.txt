No voice can sing, 
No heart can frame,
Nor can the mem'ry find
A sweeter sound 
Than Thy blest name, 
O Savior of mankind!

O hope of ev'ry contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall, 
How kind Thou art; 
How good to those who seek!

But what to those who find.
Ah! This no tongue nor pen can show,
The love of Jesus! what it is 
None but His loved ones know.

Saviour, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our crown shalt be;
Be Thou, O Lord our glory now
And thro' eternity.
