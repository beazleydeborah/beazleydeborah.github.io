Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
don't lean on your own understanding.
In all your ways acknowledge Him,
and He will make your paths straight.

Do not be wise in your own eyes;
fear the Lord and turn from evil.
It will be healing to your body,
and refreshment to your bones.

Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
don't lean on your own understanding.
In all your ways acknowledge Him,
and He will make your paths straight.
