  D         G%
This is My body 
  D         G%
broken for you 
  D            Bm%
bringing you wholeness,
G            A%
making you free. 
 Em         A%
Take it and eat it 
 D            Bm%
and when you do, 
G         A        D%
do it in love for Me.

This is My blood 
poured out for you 
bringing forgiveness, 
making you free. 
Take it and drink it 
and when you do,
do it in love for Me.
