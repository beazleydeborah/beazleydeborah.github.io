Lord, in the fullness of my might, 
            F    D7 
I would for Thee be strong;
      C       F         Dm   G  C%
while runneth o'er each dear delight,
               F    G  C% 
to Thee should soar my song.
=
I would not give the world my heart,
and then profess Thy love; 
I would not feel my strength depart,
and then Thy service prove.
=
I would not with swift winged zeal
on the world's errands go: 
and labor up the heav'nly hill 
with weary feet and slow.
=
O not for Thee my weak desires,
my poorer baser part!
O not for Thee my fading fires,
the ashes of my heart.
=
O choose me in my golden time,
in my dear joys have part.
For Thee the glory of my prime, 
the fullness of my heart.
