Have Thine own way, Lord. Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Master, today. 
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord. Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray. 
Power - all power - surely is Thine. 
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!

Have Thine own way, Lord. Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being absolute sway. 
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see 
Christ only, always living in me!
