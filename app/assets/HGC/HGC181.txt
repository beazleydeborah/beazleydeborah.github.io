What Child is this, who, laid to rest, 
on Mary's lap is sleeping. 
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, 
while shepherds watch are keeping?
=
This, this is Christ the King, 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing: 
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary.
=
Why lies He in such mean estate 
where ox and lamb are feeding. 
Good Christian, fear - for  sinners here 
the silent Word is pleading.

This, this is Christ the King,

Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come, rich and poor, to own Him, 
the King of kings salvation brings
let loving hearts enthrone Him.
