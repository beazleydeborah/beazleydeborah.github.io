PSALMS 34:1-4
=
I will bless the Lord at all times;
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
My soul shall make its boast in the Lord;
The humble shall hear it and rejoice.
=
O magnify the Lord with me,
And let us exalt His name together.
I sought the Lord and He answered me,
And delivered me from all my fears.
