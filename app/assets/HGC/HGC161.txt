My rest is in heaven,
    D           A%
my rest is not here, 
      E            A%
then why should I murmur 
       B7        E7%
when trials are near.

Be hushed, my sad spirit; 
     D              A%
the worst that can come 
                   D%
but shortens the journey 
     E7         A%
and hastens me home.

For the Lion of Judah 
       D           A%
shall break every chain 
     E            A%
and give us the victory 
  B7       E7%
again and again.

It is not for me to 
be seeking my bliss, 
and building my hopes
in a region like this; 
I look for a city which
hands have not piled, 
I pant for a country 
by sin undefiled.

For the Lion of Judah 
shall break every chain 
and give us the victory 
again and again.

Let trial and danger 
my progress oppose, 
they only make heaven 
more sweet at the close;
come joy or come sorrow, 
whate'er may befall, 
a home with my God 
will make up for it all.
=
For the Lion of Judah 
shall break every chain 
and give us the victory 
again and again.

With Christ in my heart, 
and His Word in my hand, 
I travel in haste,
through an enemy's land; 
the road may be rough,
but it cannot be long, 
so I journey on, 
singing the conqueror's song.
