Fair are the meadows, 
fairer still the woodlands,
robed in the blooming garb of spring: 
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer, 
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

Fair is the sunshine, 
fairer still the moonlight, 
and all the twinkling starry host:
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer 
than all the angels heav'n can boast.

Beautiful Savior. Lord of the nations. 
Son of God and Son of Man. 
Glory and honor, praise, adoration 
now and forevermore be Thine!
