O the deep, deep love of Jesus; 
Spread His praise from shore to shore; 
How He loveth, ever loveth, 
Changeth never, nevermore; 
How He watches o'er His loved ones, 
Died to call them all His own; 
How for them He intercedeth, 
Watcheth o'er them from the throne.

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
Love of ev'ry love the best; 
'tis an ocean vast of blessing, 
'tis a haven sweet of rest, 
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
'tis a heav'n of heav'ns to me; 
And it lifts me up to glory, 
For it lifts me up to Thee.
