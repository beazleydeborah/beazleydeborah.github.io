A MIGHTY FORTRESS

  C       G   Em  Am D   G%
A mighty fortress is our God,
Am Em F   C  Am  Dm-G C%
A bulwark never failing;
           G   Em Am D  G%
Our helper He, amid the flood 
Am Em  F  C    Am Dm-G C%
Of mortal ills prevailing:
          Am  G D      G%
For still our ancient foe 
C    G    C  F     Dm Am%
Doth seek to work us woe;
E   Am    E   Am     D   G%
His craft and pow'r are great,
F         C    A  Dm E% 
And armed with cruel hate,
Am Em    F  C   Am  Dm-G C%
On earth is not His equal.

Did we in our own strength confide, 
our striving would be losing; 
were not the right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing: 
dost ask who that may be. 
Christ Jesus, it is He, 
Lord Sabaoth, His name, 
from age to age the same,
and He must win the battle.
=
And tho' this world, with devils filled, 
should threaten to undo us, 
we will not fear, for God hath willed 
His truth to triumph through us: 
the prince of darkness grim - 
we tremble not for him; 
his rage we can endure, 
for lo! his doom is sure, 
one little word will fell him.
=
That word above all earthly pow'rs, 
no thanks to them, abideth; 
the Spirit and the gifts are ours 
through Him who with us sideth:
let goods and kindred go, 
this mortal life also; 
the body they may kill: 
God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever.
