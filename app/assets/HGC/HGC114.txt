May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me, 
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm and changeless be - 
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away, 
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll,
Blest Savior, then, in love,
Fear and distrust remove - 
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul.
