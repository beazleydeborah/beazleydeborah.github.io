Psalms 86:12-13
=
I will praise Thee, O Lord my God,
with all my heart, with all my heart.
And I will glorify Thy name for evermore,
with all my heart, 
for great is Thy mercy toward me;
and Thou hast delivered my soul 
from the lowest hell.
I will praise Thee, O Lord my God,
with all my heart, with all my heart.
And I will glorify Thy name for evermore,
with all my heart.
