Be still, my soul:
thy God doth undertake 
to guide the future 
as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence 
let nothing shake; 
all now mysterious 
shall be bright at last. 
Be still, my soul: 
the waves and winds still know 
His voice who ruled
them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul: 
the hour is hast'ning on 
when we shall be forever 
with the Lord, 
when disappointment, grief, 
and fear are gone, 
sorrow forgot,
love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: 
when change and tears are past, 
all safe and blessed
we shall meet at last.
