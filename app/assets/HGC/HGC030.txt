O to grace how great a debtor 
daily I'm constrained to be. 
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter, 
bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it; 
prone to leave the God I love: 
yet Thou, Lord, hast deigned to seal it, 
with Thy Spirit from above.

Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wand'ring from the fold of God; 
He to save my soul from danger, 
interposed His precious blood.
Rescued thus from sin and danger, 
purchased by the Savior's blood,
may I walk on earth a stranger, 
as a son and heir of God.
