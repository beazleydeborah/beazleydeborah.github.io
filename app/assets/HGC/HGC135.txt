THE WORK SONG 
=
We must work the works of Him who sent us, as long 
as it is day; we must work the works of Him who sent 
us, as long as it is day; night is coming, when no man 
can work.

The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest 
to send out workers into His harvest.

Truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works 
that I do shall he do also; and greater works than 
these shall he do; that the Father may be glorified 
in the Son… the Son… the Son.
=
We must work the works of Him who sent us, as long 
as it is day; we must work the works of Him who sent 
us, as long as it is day; night is coming, when no man 
can work.

Therefore my beloved brethren, be steadfast, 
immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord.

Truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works 
that I do shall he do also; and greater works than 
these shall he do; that the Father may be glorified 
in the Son… the Son… the Son.

We must work the works of Him who sent us, as long
