Do not be afraid, little flock,
for your Father has chosen
gladly to give you the kingdom.

You too, be ready;
for the Son of Man is coming
at an hour that you do not expect.
(You too be ready, you too be ready)

You too be patient;
strengthen your hearts,
for the coming of the Lord is at hand.

For the coming of the Lord is at hand.
