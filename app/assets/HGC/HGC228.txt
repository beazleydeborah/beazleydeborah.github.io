LET'S TALK ABOUT JESUS
=
Let's talk about Jesus, 
the King of Kings is He,
the Lord of Lords supreme, 
through all eternity,
the great "I Am", the Way, 
the Truth, the Life, the Door.
Let's talk about Jesus, 
more and more.
=
More and more (More and more) 
I want to magnify His name,
more and more (More and more) 
I want to spread abroad His fame, 
more and more (more and more) 
Oh, make my life a living flame, 
melt my heart, precious Lord, 
more and more.
