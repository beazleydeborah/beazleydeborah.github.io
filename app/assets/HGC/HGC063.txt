Born of the Spirit with life from above
into God's family divine, 
justified fully through Calvary's love,
O what a standing is mine.
And the transaction so quickly was made
when as a sinner I came,
took of the offer of grace He did proffer 
He saved me, O praise His dear name!

Now I've a hope that will surely endure
after the passing of time;
I have a future in heaven for sure,
there in those mansions sublime.
And it's because of that wonderful day 
when at the cross I believed;
riches eternal and blessings supernal
from His precious hand I received.
