Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand, 
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand; 
Not a surge of worry not a shade of care, 
Not a blast of hurry, touch the spirit there.

Traced upon our dial by the Son of Love. 
We may trust Him fully all for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.
