=
For Thou art my lamp, O Lord; 
And the Lord illumines my darkness. 
Thy word is a lamp to my feet,
And a light to my path.
And so we have the prophetic word
Made more sure,
To which you do well to pay attention
As to a lamp shining in a dark place,
Until the day dawns and the 
Morning star arises in your hearts.
