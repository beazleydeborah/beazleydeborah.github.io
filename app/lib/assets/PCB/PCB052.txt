The Holy Heart
=
The Holy Heart once broken,
Sent from the Father's side.
The Son of God forsaken,
The holy sacrifice.
=
For me He was forsaken,
For me He died alone.
My sin forever taken,
That I might be His own.
=
The Holy Lamb was stricken,
Abandoned and alone,
He bore the world's afflicton,
He bore it as His own.
=
For me He was forsaken,
For me He died alone.
My sin forever taken,
That I might be His own.
=
And when my heart is broken,
Torn by my sin and pride;
The Son of God now risen
Will draw me to His side.
=
For me He was forsaken,
For me He died alone.
My sin forever taken,
That I might be His own.
