The Lion And The Lamb

Who is He? who's the mightiest of all?
Who is He? Creation trembles at His call.
Who is He? The lowly sacrifice
Who paid the victim's price:
His name is Jesus.

Jesus, from the Fathers own right hand.
Jesus, Son of God and Son of man.
Jesus, who died and rose again;
Jesus, He's the Lion and the Lamb.

Who is He with the power none can tame?
Who is He when ev'ry foe
   would fear his name?
Who is He who was humbly led away
To suffer that dark day?
His name is Jesus.

Jesus, from the Fathers own right hand.
Jesus, Son of God and Son of man.
Jesus, who died and rose again;
Jesus, He's the Lion and the Lamb.

Who is He with the eyes that burn like fire?
Who is He? Oh the wonder He inspires.
Who is He? He bore the guilt and shame
For the ones who'd gone astray,
His name is Jesus.

Jesus, from the Fathers own right hand.
Jesus, Son of God and Son of man.
Jesus, who died and rose again;
Jesus, He's the Lion and the Lamb.
