Let Us Worship Lord Jehovah

Waiting in HIs holy presence,
Silent now before His throne;
Let us worship Lord, Jehovah,'
Bringing gifts to Him alone.

We will bow before HIs majesty,
Loving Him with hearts aflame;
Kings and priests to serve His righteousness,
We will stand and praise His name.

Lifting high the royal banners, 
We proclaim His Kingdom reign;
We will crown Him King forever,
We exalt His glorious name.

King and Lord of all creation,
Sovereign in authority;
We will never cease to praise Him,
Throughout all eternity.
