Seek Ye First
=
Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness;
And all these things shall be added unto you,
Allelu, alleluia.
=
Man shall not live by bread alone,
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God,
Allelu, Alleluia
=
Ask, and it shall be given unto you.
Seek, and ye shall find.
Knock, and the door
   shall be opened unto you,
Allelu, alleluia
