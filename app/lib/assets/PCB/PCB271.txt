I'm Forever Grateful
=
You did not wait for me to draw near to You,
But You clothed Yourself in frail humanity.
You did not wait for me to cry out to You,
But You let me hear Your voice calling me.
=
And I'm forever grateful to You.
I'm forever grateful for the cross;
I'm forever grateful to You
That You came to seek and save the lost.
=
You saw me as a pearl
   of the greatest price,
And you gave up all You had
   to purchase me.
I was the lost lamb that had gone astray,
But You left the ninety-nine to rescue me.
=
And I'm forever grateful to You.
I'm forever grateful for the cross;
I'm forever grateful to You
That You came to seek and save the lost.
