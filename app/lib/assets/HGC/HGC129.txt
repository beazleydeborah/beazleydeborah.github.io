Oh, teach me what it meaneth;
that sacred crimson tide, 
the blood and water flowing from 
Thine own wounded side. 
Teach me that if none other 
had sinned, but I alone,
yet still, Thy blood, Lord Jesus,
Thine only, must atone

Oh, teach me what it meaneth;
Thy love beyond compare, 
the love that reacheth deeper 
than depths of self-despair, 
yea, teach me, till there gloweth 
in this poor heart of mine, 
some feeble, pale reflection 
of that pure heart of Thine.
=
Oh, teach me what it meaneth;
for I am full of sin; 
and grace alone can reach me, 
and love alone can win.
Oh teach me, for I need Thee, 
I have no hope beside,
the chief of all the sinners
for whom the Savior died.
=
Oh Infinite Redeemer, 
I bring no other plea,
because Thou dost invite me 
I cast myself on Thee.
Because Thou dost accept me 
I love and I adore;
because Thy love constraineth,
I'll praise Thee evermore.
