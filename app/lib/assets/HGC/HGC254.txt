ISAIAH 53:5-6
=
All we like sheep have gone astray
we've turned everyone to his own way;
but the Lord has laid on Him
the iniquity of us all.
=
He bore our sorrows and our shame.
He took away our sin.
And He has healed us by His stripes,
and made us whole again.
 =
All we like sheep have gone astray
we've turned everyone to his own way;
but the Lord has laid on Him 
the iniquity of us all.
