Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
save in the cross of Christ, my God; 
all the vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet, 
sorrow and love flow mingled down;
did e'er such love and sorrow meet, 
or thorns compose so rich a crown?
=
Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
that were an off'ring far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my heart, my life, my all!
