II SAMUEL 22:29, PSALMS 119:105, II PETER 1:19
=
For Thou art my lamp, O Lord; and the Lord illumines my 
darkness. Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my 
path. And so we have the prophetic word made more 
sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp 
shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the 
morning star arises in your hearts.
