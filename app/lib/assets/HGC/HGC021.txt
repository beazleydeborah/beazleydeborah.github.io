Holy, holy, holy, 
all the saints adore Thee,
casting down their golden crowns 
around the glassy sea; 
cherubim and seraphim
falling down before Thee,
Who wert, and art, 
and evermore shalt be.

Holy, holy, holy, 
though the darkness hide Thee,
though the eye of sinful man 
Thy glory may not see,
only Thou art holy; 
there is none beside Thee
perfect in pow'r,
in love and purity.

Holy, holy, holy, 
Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, 
in earth, and sky, and sea; 
holy, holy, holy. 
Merciful and mighty!
God in Three Persons, 
blessed Trinity!
