PSALMS 8:1, 3-4
=
O Lord, our Lord, 
how excellent is Thy 
name in all the earth. 
When I consider Thy heavens,
the work of Thy fingers, 
the moon the stars, 
which Thou hast ordained; 
what is man, 
that Thou art mindful of Him? 
And the son of man, 
that Thou visitest him. 
O Lord, our Lord, 
how excellent is Thy
name in all the earth!
