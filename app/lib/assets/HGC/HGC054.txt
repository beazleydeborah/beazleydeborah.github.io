A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away; 
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God 
For such a Redeemer as mine!

When clothed in His brightness,
Transported I rise 
to meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.
