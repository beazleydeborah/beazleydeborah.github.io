How deep the Father's love for us,
      E%
how vast beyond
    C#m   B%
all measure
     E                F#m E/G# A%
That he should give his only Son, to
 E%
make a wretch
         B    E%
his treasure
      E              F#m E/G# A#%
How great the pain of searing loss,
      E%
the Father
           C#m  B%
turns his face away
     E                 F#m E/G# A%
As wounds which mar the chosen one,
       E%
bring many
        B   E%
sons to glory

Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his
C#m  B%
shoulders
 E                F#m E/G# A%
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
      E%
call out among
    B    E%
the scoffers
                    Em - D     G%
It was my sin that held him there
  D%
until it was
Bm    A% 
accomplished
     E               F#m E/G#   A%
His dying breath has brought me life
   E%
I know that
      B   E%
it is finished
=
  E                F#m E/G# A%
I will not boast in anything: no
 E%
gifts, no power,
   C#m B%
no wisdom
    E             F#m E/G# A%
But I will boast in Jesus Christ;
      E%
his death and
       B    E%
resurrection
                      F#m E/G# A%
Why should I gain from his reward? I
   E%
cannot give
   C#m B%
an answer
     E              F#m E/G# A%
But this I know with all my heart:
      E%
his wounds have
        B   E%
paid my ransom
