Oh, how great Thy loving kindness, vaster, broader
than the sea! Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness,

Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus, I behold Thee as 
Thou art, and Thy love, so pure, so changeless,

meets, supplies its every need, compasseth me round

Ever lift Thy face upon me, as I work and wait for Thee;
resting 'neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus, earth's dark 
shadows flee. Brightness of my Father's glory, 
sunshine of my Father's face, keep me ever trusting, 
resting, fill me with Thy grace.
