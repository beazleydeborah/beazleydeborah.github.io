=
I will rejoice greatly in the Lord,
my soul will exult in my God, in my God.
Oh, I will rejoice greatly in the Lord,
my soul will exult in my God, in my God;
for He has clothed me with 
the garments of salvation,
He has wrapped me 
with a robe of righteousness.
I will rejoice. I will rejoice. I will rejoice!
I will rejoice. I will rejoice!
