GLORY TO GOD
=
Glory to God, He has lifted me up, 
He has lifted me up, I know; 
glory to God, He has lifted me up, 
and that's why I love Him so. 
I love Him more and more; 
I love Him more and more; 
and when, by faith, I reach the other shore, 
I'll praise Him more and more, 
and when, by faith, I reach the other shore, 
I'll praise Him more and more.
