Alas, and did my Savior bleed? 
And did my Sovereign die? 
Would He devote that sacred head
for such a worm as I?

Was it for crimes that I have done, 
He groaned upon the tree? 
amazing pity! grace unknown! 
And love beyond degree!
=
Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
and shut his glories in, 
when Christ the mighty Maker, 
died for man the creature's, sin.
=
But drops of grief can ne'er repay 
the debt of love I owe:
here, Lord, I give myself away, 
'tis all that I can do!
