Soon and very soon
My King is coming
Clothed in righteousness
And crowned with love
When I see Him I
Shall be made like Him
Soon and very soon

I'll be going 
To the place He has
Prepared for me
There my sin erased
My shame forgotten
Soon and very soon

I will be with the one I love
With unveiled face I'll see Him
There my soul will be satisfied
Soon and very soon

Soon and very soon
See the procession
The angels and the elders
Round the throne
At His feet I'll lay
My crown, my worship
Soon and very soon
