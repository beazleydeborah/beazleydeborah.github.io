The sun cannot compare
To the glory of Your love 
There is no shadow in Your Presence 
No mortal man would dare
To stand before Your throne 
Before the Holy One of heaven 
It's only by Your Blood
And it's only through you mercy 
Lord I come

I bring an offering of worship to my King 
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing 
Jesus may You receive the honor that You're due 
O Lord I bring an offering to You 
I bring an offering to You 
=
O Lord I bring an offering to You 
O Lord I bring an offering to You 
I bring an offering to You
