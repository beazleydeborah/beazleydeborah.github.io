title:Make Me Like You
order:1,2,3,2,2
=
With mercy You’ve shown me Your unfailing love
Your holiness purges my sin
Your blood has redeemed me, I’m washed in Your grace
With patience You cleanse me within
=
Make me, like You;
Take the pieces of my life and make it new.
Make me like you;
Make me wholly completely brand new.
=
To love the unloved ones, to count all but loss
I take up my cross for You.
To picture You broken, to see You as King,
For You I will do anything.
