John 3:15-21
=
"For God so loved the world
that He gave his one and only son,
that whoever believes in him
shall not perish
but have eternal life.
=
For God did not send His son
into the world to condemn the world,
but to save the world through Him.
Whoever believes in Him is not condemned,
but whoever does not believe
stands condemned already
because he has not believed
in the name of God's one and only son.
=
This is the verdict:
Light has come into the world
But men loved darkness instead of light
because their deeds were evil.
Everyone who does evil hates the light,
and will not come into the light
for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
But whoever lives by the truth
comes into the light,
so that it may be seen plainly 
that what he has done 
has been done through God"
