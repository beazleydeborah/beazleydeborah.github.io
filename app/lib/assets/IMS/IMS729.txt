Hark the Herald Angels Sing
Glory to the new born King
Peace on Earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the new-born King."
=
Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the everlasting Lord,
Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
Hail th'incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with men to dwell,
Jesus, our Emmanuel,
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the new-born King."
=
Hail the heav'n born Prince of Peace,
Hail the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris'n with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the new-born King."
