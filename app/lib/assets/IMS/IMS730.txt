March of the Kings
=
Three great kings I met at early morn
With all their retinue were slowly marching
Three great kings I met at early morn
Were on their way to meet the newly born
With gifts of gold brought from far away
And valiant warriors to guard the kingly treasure
With gifts of gold brought from far away
And shield all shining in their bright array.
