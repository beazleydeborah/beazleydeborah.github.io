Sent forth by God’s blessing, 
our true faith confessing  
the people of
God from this dwelling take leave. 
The supper is ended, 
Oh now be extended
the Fruits of this service 
in all who believe
=
The fruit of Christ’s teaching 
receptive souls reaching
Shall blossom in action for 
God and for all.
His grace did invite us, 
His love shall unite us
To work for God’s kingdom 
And answer his call
=
With praise and thanksgiving 
To God ever living
The tasks of our everyday 
Life we will face.
Our faith ever sharing
In love ever caring
Embracing the children 
Of each tribe and race.
=
With your feast you feed us, 
With your light now lead us
Unite us in one 
In this life that we share 
Then may all the living 
With praise and thanksgiving 
Give honor to Christ 
And his name that we bear.
