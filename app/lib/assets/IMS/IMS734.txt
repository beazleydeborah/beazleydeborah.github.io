Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem,
Shining afar thru shadows dim,
Giving a light for those
Who long have gone
And guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay,
Beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on.

Oh beautiful star (beautiful beautiful star)
Of Bethlehem (star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawn
Oh give us thy light to light the way
Into the land of perfect day,
Beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on.

Oh beautiful star, the hope of light,
Guiding the pilgrim thru the night
Over the mountain till the break of dawn
And into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray,
Beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on.

Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest,
For the redeemed, the good, and blest,
Yonder in glory when the crown is won,
For Jesus is now that Star divine,
Brighter and brighter He will shine,
Beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on.
