I'M REDEEMED
=
Well, I'm redeemed by love divine,
well, glory, glory, glory, 
glory, Christ is mine. 
Unto Him I have resigned I have been, 
I've been redeemed.
=
Well, I'm redeemed 
by the blood of the Lamb,
well, I'm redeemed 
by the blood of the Lamb,
well, I'm redeemed 
by the blood of the Lamb,
now how thankful and glad I am,
all my sins are under the blood, 
I've been redeemed.
