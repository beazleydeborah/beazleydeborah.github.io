Psalm 19:1-6
order: 1,2,3,1
=
The heavens are telling
Of the glory of God;
And their expanse is declaring
The work of His hands.
Day to day pours forth speech,
And night to night
Reveals knowledge.
There is no speech,
Nor are there words;
Their voice is not heard.
=
Their line has gone out
Through all the earth,
And their utterances
To the end of the world.
In them He has placed
A tent for the sun,
Which is as a bridegroom
Coming out of his chamber;
=
It rejoices as a strong man
To run his course.
Its rising is from
One end of the heavens,
And its circuit
To the other end of them;
And there is nothing
Hidden from its heat.
