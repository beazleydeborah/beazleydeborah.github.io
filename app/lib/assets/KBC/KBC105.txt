I Waited
=
I waited for the Lord on high,
I waited and He heard my cry
=
He pulled me out of my despair
He taught me how to walk
From fear into security
From quicksand to the rock...
=
I waited for the Lord on high,
I waited and He heard my cry
=
I sing to let the people know
That I have been restored
And they will kneel and understand
To return and trust the Lord...
=
And there's a new song
In my heart to sing
A new song praises to my King
