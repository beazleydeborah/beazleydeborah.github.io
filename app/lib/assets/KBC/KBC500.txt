Rule Number One

Rule number one, rule number one,
And I say just be nice.
Little children, it's been a long cold lonely winter.
Little children, it seems a year since we've been here.
Rule number one, rule number one,
And I say just be nice.
=
Little children, the smiles returning to the faces.
Little children, they're coming here from many places.
Rule number one, rule number one,
And I say just be nice.
=
One, one, one, just be nice.
One, one, one, just be nice.
One, one, one, just be nice.
One, one, one, just be nice.
One, one, one, just be nice!
=
Little children, we love because we've first been loved.
Little children, they'll know we're Christians by our love.
Rule number one, rule number one,
And I say just be nice.
=
Rule number one, rule number one.
Just be nice, just be nice.

Rule Number Two

I'm sittin' here all alone,
Thinkin' what I might have done.
I thought that I couldn't miss,
But it ended up like this.
Don't be a fool, it's the second rule.
It ain't just the staff I love,
It's the whole camp that I'm thinkin' of!
=
Look at me no hands!
I do what the crowd demands!
I've done this a million times!
Only ends up bad sometimes!
Don't be a fool, it's the second rule.
It ain't just the staff I love,
It's the whole camp that I'm thinkin' of!
=
Rule Number Three

Obey God and you'll be sitting
On top of the world!
=
Don't be afraid to try the greatest life around.
     (Obey God, obey God)
Not everybody tries it once.
Those who don't just have to put it down.
    (Obey God, obey God)
One reads His word, turns around, obeys,
And, baby, that's all there is,
And you will be amazed!
You gotta obey God and you're sittin'
On top of the world!
=
Not just a fad cause it's been going on so long.
    (Obey God, obey God)
All the saints going strong.
They said it couldn't last too long.
    (Obey God, obey God)
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon,
And watch us live our lives,
And sing another tune,
As we obey we'll be
Sittin' on top of the world!
=
Obey God and you're
Sittin' on top of the world.
=
So take a lesson from a life-long Christian boy.
    (Obey God, obey God)
Get yourself a Holy Word,
But don't you treat it like a toy.
    (Obey God, obey God)
Just get away from the other stuff,
And follow all it says, it will be enough,
And when you
Obey God you'll be sittin'
On top of the world
=
Obey God and you're
Sittin' on top of the world.

Rule Number Four

You can serve, you can play,
Having the time of your life, ooh, ooooh.
When they come, be unseen.
Please don't make a scene.
=
Camp's for campers, we all know.
Serving them, it's the way to go.
Let them hear the gospel, this is the thing.
Help them to find the King.
=
Tell them how the Savior died,
And to lift His name on high.
He was resurrected as it was prophesied.
So when you get the chance,
In every circumstance...
=
That's who the camp is for,
Campers get the floor, oh forevermore!
Number four.
When they're seen, then flee the scene, oh yeah!
You can serve, you can play,
Having the time of your life, ooh, ooooh.
When they come, be unseen.
Please don't make a scene.
=
As an example focus on,
How you show Christ whereupon.
Loving one another, that's what we'll do.
In every circumstance,
And when you get the chance...
=
That's who the camp is for,
Campers get the floor, oh forevermore!
Number four.
When they're seen, then flee the scene, oh yeah!
You can serve, you can play,
Having the time of your life, ooh, ooooh.
When they come, be unseen.
Please don't make a scene.
