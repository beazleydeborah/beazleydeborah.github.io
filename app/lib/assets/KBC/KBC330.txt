Oh How Good It Is
order:1,2,3,2,4,2
=
Oh how good it is 
When the family of God
Dwells together in spirit 
In faith and unity. 
Where the bonds of peace, 
Of acceptance and love 
Are the fruit of His presence 
Here among us. 
=
So with one voice
We'll sing to the Lord 
And with one heart
We'll live out His word 
Till the whole earth sees 
The Redeemer has come
For He dwells in the
Presence of His people. 
=
Oh how good it is 
On this journey we share 
To rejoice with the happy 
And weep with those who mourn. 
For the weak find strength 
The afflicted find grace 
When we offer the blessing 
Of belonging. 
=
Oh how good it is 
To embrace His command 
To prefer one another
Forgive as He forgives. 
When we live as one 
We all share in the love 
Of the Son with the Father 
And the Spirit.
