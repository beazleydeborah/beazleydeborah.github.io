My Savior, My God
=
I am not skilled to understand 
What God has willed, what God has planned 
I only know at His right hand 
Stands One Who is my Savior 

I take Him at His word indeed 
"Christ died for sinners;" this I read 
And in my heart I find a need 
Of Him to be my Savior
=
That He would leave His place on high 
And come for sinful man to die 
You count it strange, so once did I 
Before I knew my Savior 
=
My Savior loves, My Savior lives 
My Savior's always there for me 
My God He was, my God He is 
My God He's always gonna be 
My Savior loves, My Savior lives 
My Savior's always there for me 
My God He was, my God He is 
My God He's always gonna be 
=
And, Oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me
And with His work contented be
As I with my dear Savior

Yes, living, dying, let me bring 
My strength, my solace from this spring; 
That He who lives to be my King 
Once died to be my Savior 
=
That He would leave His place on high 
And come for sinful man to die 
You count it strange, so once did I 
Before I knew my Savior
=
My Savior loves, My Savior lives 
My Savior's always there for me 
My God He was, my God He is 
My God He's always gonna be 
My Savior loves, My Savior lives 
My Savior's always there for me 
My God He was, my God He is 
My God He's always gonna be
