2 Timothy 4:1-5
order:1,2,3,4,4
=
I solemnly charge you
in the presence of God
and of Christ Jesus,
who is to judge
the living and the dead,
and by His appearing and His kingdom:
preach the word;
=
be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort,
with great patience and instruction.
=
For the time will come
when they will not endure sound doctrine;
but wanting to have their ears tickled,
they will accumulate for themselves
teachers in accordance to their own desires,
and will turn away their ears from the truth
and will turn aside to myths.
=
But you, be sober in all things,
endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist,
fulfill your ministry.
