Peace Be Still
=
Master, the tempest is raging!
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'er-shadowed with blackness
No shelter or help is nigh

Carest Thou not that we perish,
How canst Thou lie asleep
When each moment so madly is threatning
A grave in the angry deep
=
The wind and the waves shall obey My will
Peace... be still (Peace be still, peace be still)

Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons or men or whatever it be
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will,
Peace be still, Peace be still
They all shall sweetly obey My will,
Peace, Peace be still
=
Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today
The depths of my sad heart are troubled
O waken and save, I pray

Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul
And I perish, I perish dear Master
O hasten and take control
=
The wind and the waves shall obey My will
Peace... be still (Peace be still, peace be still)

Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons or men or whatever it be
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will,
Peace be still, Peace be still
They all shall sweetly obey My will,
Peace, Peace be still
=
Master, the terror is over
The elements sweetly rest
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored
And heaven's within my breast

Linger, O blessed Redeemer
Leave me alone no more
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor
And rest on the blissful shore

=
The wind and the waves shall obey My will
Peace... be still (Peace be still, peace be still)

Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons or men or whatever it be
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will,
Peace be still, Peace be still
They all shall sweetly obey My will,
Peace, Peace be still
