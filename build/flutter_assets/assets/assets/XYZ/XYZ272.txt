HE'S ABLE
=
He's able, He's able, 
I know He's able.
I know my Lord is able 
to carry me through.
(repeat)
=
He heals the broken-hearted, 
and He sets the captive free.
He made the lame to walk again,
and He caused the blind to see.
Oh yes, He's able, He's able, 
I know He's able.
I know my Lord is able 
to carry me through.
