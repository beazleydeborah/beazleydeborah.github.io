Jesus, I love you, my Lord, my life.
Where would I be without you?

I am in awe of You

Here in the quiet, the still, the night,
I am in awe of You.

Trials may come and friends they may go
What really matters is You, my Lord.

Why would you, Creator and King,
Come as a baby for all, for me?

Beautiful savior, my God, my Friend
I am in awe of You, Lord.
I am in awe of you.
