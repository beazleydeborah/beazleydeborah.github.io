Awesome In This Place
=
As I come into Your presence,
Past the gates of praise,
Into Your sanctuary
Till we're standing face to face;
I look  upon  Your countenance,
I see the fullness of Your grace,
And I can only bow down and say.
=
"You are awesome in this place,
Mighty God, 
You are awesome in this place,
Abba Father;
You are worthy of all praise,
To You our lives we raise,
You are awesome in this place,
Mighty God."
