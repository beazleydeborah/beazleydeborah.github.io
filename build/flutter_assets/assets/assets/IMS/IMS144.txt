=
There's  nobody else like me, 
there's nobody else like me. 
I'm not a horse or a hog 
or a fish or a frog. 
I'm a human, can't you see? 
There's nobody else like me, 
God created me carefully. 
There's nobody else 
No, there's nobody else like me.

I am an individual created by God's own hand. 
And He has a special purpose for me, 
I am part of His wonderful plan. 
God formed me into a human, 
I'm not a squirrel or a squid or a skunk. 
I know He loves me 'cause I'm specially made, 
God just doesn't make junk.
