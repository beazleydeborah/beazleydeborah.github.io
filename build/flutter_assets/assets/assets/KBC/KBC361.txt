Psalm 1

How blessed is the man
         D%
who does not walk
       C              G%
in the counsel of the wicked,
                         D%
Nor stand in the path of sinners,
    C                      D%
Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!

        C                            G%
But his delight is in the law of the LORD,
           Em                       D%
And in His law he meditates day and night.
        C         G%
He will be like a tree
    Em   D        C          G%
firmly planted by streams of water,
      Em         D            C  G%
Which yields its fruit in its season
        Em            D%
And its leaf does not wither;
                C  G        D%
And in whatever he does, he prospers.

The wicked are not so,
    D%
But they are like chaff
          C           D%
which the wind drives away.
              Em%
Therefore the wicked
                      D%
will not stand in the judgment,
            Em                         D%
Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
        C                         G%
For the LORD knows the way of the righteous,
        Em                       D%
But the way of the wicked will perish.
