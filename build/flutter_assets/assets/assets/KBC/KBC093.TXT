I Lift My Eyes Up

I lift my eyes up
Up to the mountains
Where does my help come from
My help comes from You
Maker of heaven Creator of the earth
=
Oh how I need You Lord
You are my only hope
You're my only prayer
And I will wait for You
To come and rescue me
To come and give me life
=
I lift my eyes up
Up to the mountains
Where does my help come from
