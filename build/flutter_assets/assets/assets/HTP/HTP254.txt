When I survey
=
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Lord of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
=
It was on the Cross He shed His blood,
It was there He was crucified;
But He rose again, and lives in my heart,
Where all is peace and perfect love.
=
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.
=
It was on the Cross He shed His blood,
It was there He was crucified;
But He rose again, and lives in my heart,
Where all is peace and perfect love.
=
See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
=
It was on the Cross He shed His blood,
It was there He was crucified;
But He rose again, and lives in my heart,
Where all is peace and perfect love.
=
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small:
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my heart, my life, my all.
=
It was on the Cross He shed His blood,
It was there He was crucified;
But He rose again, and lives in my heart,
Where all is peace and perfect love.
