The Trees Of The Field
=
You shall go out with joy
And be led forth with peace
The mountains and the hills
Will break forth before you
There'll be shouts of joy
And all the trees of the field
Will clap, will clap their hands
=
And all the trees of the field
   Will clap their hands
The trees of the field
   Will clap their hands
The trees of the field
   Will clap their hands
As you go out for joy
