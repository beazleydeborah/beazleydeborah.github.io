Our God Reigns
=
How lovely on the mountains
   are the feet of Him
Who brings good news, good news.
Announcing peace,
   proclaiming news of happiness,
Our God reigns, our God reigns.
Our God reigns, our God reigns;
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
=
He had no stately form, He had no majesty
That we should be drawn to Him.
He was despised
   and we took no account of Him,
Yet now He reigns with the Most High.
Now He reigns, now He reigns;
Now He reigns with the Most High.
=
It was our sin and guilt
   that bruised and wounded Him,
It was our sin that brought Him down;
When we, like sheep,
   had gone astray, our Shepherd came
And on His shoulders bore our shame.
On His shoulders, on His shoulders;
On His shoulders He bore our shame.
=
Meek as a lamb
   that's led out to the slaughterhouse,
Dumb as a sheep before its shearer,
His life ran down upon the ground
   like pouring rain,
That we might be born again.
That we might be, that we might be,
That we might be born again.
=
Out from the tomb came
   He with grace and majesty,
He is alive, He is alive
God loves us so, see here His hands,
   His feet, His side,
Yes, we know, He is alive.
He is alive, He is alive;
He is alive, He is alive.
=
How lovely on the mountains
   are the feet of Him
Who brings good news, good news.
Announcing peace,
   proclaiming news of happiness,
Our God reigns, our God reigns.
Our God reigns, our God reigns;
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
