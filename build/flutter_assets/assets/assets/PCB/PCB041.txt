In His Time
=
In His time, in His time,
He makes all things beautiful in his time.
Lord, please show me ev'ry day
As you're teaching me your way
That you do just what you say in Your time.
=
In Your time, In your time,
You make all things beautiful in Your time,
Lord, my life to You I bring,
May each song I have to sing
Be to You a lovely thing in Your time.
