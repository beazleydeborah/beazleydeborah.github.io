Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
causing my footsteps from God to depart; 
Jesus hath found me happy my case; 
I now am a sinner saved by grace!

Tears unavailing, no merit had I;
mercy had saved me, or else I must die;
sin had alarmed me, fearing God's face;
but now I'm a sinner saved by grace.

Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
loving his Savior to tell what he knows;
once more to tell it would I embrace -
I'm only a sinner saved by grace!
