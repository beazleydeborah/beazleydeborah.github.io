The shadow of a mighty rock

Within a weary land;

A home within the wilderness,

A rest upon the way,

From the burning of the noontide heat
F       C      G7     C% 
And the burden of the day.

O safe and happy shelter,
O refuge tried and sweet,
O trysting place where heaven's love
And heaven's justice meet!
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was giv'n
So seems my Saviour's cross to me,
A ladder up to heav'n
=
Upon the cross of Jesus, 
Mine eye at times can see 
The very dying form of One 
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart 
With tears, two wonders I confess, 
The wonder of His glorious love, 
And my unworthiness.
=
I take the cross of Jesus 
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine 
Than the sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss: 
My sinful self my only shame, 
My glory all the cross.
