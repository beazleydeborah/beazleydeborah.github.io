Oh Lord, To You
=
We will seek you first Lord,
You will hear our voices
Early in the morning and late in the night.
We will sing praises,
Giving you the glory,
Offering our lives to You a Holy sacrifice.
(repeat)
=
May our praise arise as incense
Oh Lord to You.
May our worship be a fragrance,
Oh Lord to You.
