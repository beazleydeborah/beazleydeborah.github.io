Almighty, most holy God
Faithful through the ages
Almighty, most holy Lord
Glorious almighty God!
=
The beasts of the field, the birds of the air
Are silent to call out Your name
The earth has no voice, and I have no choice
But to magnify God unashamed
Let the rocks be kept silent
For one more day
Let the whole world sing out
Let the people say
=
Almighty, most holy God
Faithful through the ages
Almighty, most holy Lord
Glorious almighty God!
=
Time marches on, with innocence gone
And a darkness has covered the earth
But His spirit still dwells, He speaks it is well
And the hopeless are offered new birth
He will break the leash of death,
It will have no sting
Let the prisoner go free
Join to dance and sing
=
Almighty, most holy God
Faithful through the ages
Almighty, most holy Lord
Glorious almighty God!
