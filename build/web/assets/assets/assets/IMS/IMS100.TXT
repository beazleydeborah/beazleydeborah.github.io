I’ve Got A River Of Life
=
I’ve got a river of life
Flowing out of me
Makes the lame to walk
And the blind to see
Opens prison doors
Sets the captives free
I've got a river of life
Flowing out of me
=
Spring up O well (Psh Psh Psh Psh)
Within my soul
Spring up O well (Splish, Splash)
And make me whole
Spring up O well (Whooosh!)
And give to me
That life abundantly
