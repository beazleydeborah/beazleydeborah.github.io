=
17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of glory, may give to you a
spirit of wisdom and of revelation in
the knowledge of Him.
18  I pray that the eyes of your heart
may be enlightened, so that you may
know what is the hope of His calling,
what are the riches of the glory of His
inheritance in the saints,
19  and what is the surpassing greatness
of His power toward us who believe.
These are in accordance with the working
of the strength of His might
