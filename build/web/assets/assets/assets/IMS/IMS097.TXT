title:Because He Lives
order:1,2,3,2,4,2
=
God sent His Son--They called Him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive;
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
=
Because He lives I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives all fear is gone,
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living just because He lives
=
How sweet to hold a newborn baby
And feel the pride and joy he gives;
But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days because He lives
=
And then one day I'll cross the river,
I'll fight life's final war with pain;
And then, as death gives way to victory,
I'll see the lights of glory--and I'll know He lives
