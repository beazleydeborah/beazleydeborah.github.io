I Need You
=
Lord, look upon my need,
I need You, I need You.
Lord, have mercy now on me,
Forgive me, oh Lord, forgive me
And I will be clean.
(repeat)
=
Oh Lord, You are familiar with my ways,
There is nothing hid from You.
Oh Lord, You know the number of my days,
I want to live my life for You.
=
Lord, have mercy now on me,
Forgive me, oh Lord, forgive me
And I will be clean.
