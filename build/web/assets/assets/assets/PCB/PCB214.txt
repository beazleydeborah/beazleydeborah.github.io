Meekness And Majesty

Meekness and majesty, manhood and Deity,
In perfect harmony, the Man who is God.
Lord of eternity dwells in humanity;
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.

O what a mystery, meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship, for this is your God.

Father's pure radiance,
   perfect in innocence,
Yet learns obedience to death on a cross.
Suff'ring to give us life, conquering through
sacrifice;
And as they crucify, prays, "Father forgive."

O what a mystery, meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship, for this is your God.

Wisdom unsearchable, God, the invisible,
Love indestructible in frailty appears.
Lord of infinity, stooping so tenderly,
Lifts our humanity to the
   heights of His throne.

O what a mystery, meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship, for this is your God.
