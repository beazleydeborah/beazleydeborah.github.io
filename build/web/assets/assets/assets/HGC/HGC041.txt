When death has come 
and taken our loved ones, 
it leaves our home so lonely and drear; 
then do we wonder why others prosper, 
living so wicked year after year.

a few more days to labor and wait; 
toils of the road will then seem as nothing, 
as we sweep through the beautiful gate.

When we see Jesus coming in glory,
when He comes from His home in the sky;
then we shall meet Him 
in that bright mansion,
we'll understand it all by and by.
