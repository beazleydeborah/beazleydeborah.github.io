Song of the Wisemen
topic:christmas
=
We have travelled afar
Following yonder star
All the way from the east we have come
Just to worship the promised king
=
And when we found the child
We placed our gifts at His feet
Now we can praise and worship Him
For He has made our joy complete
=
Let there be glory to God in the highest
Glory to God in the highest
Glory in the highest
And on earth peace good will to all men
=
Let there be glory to God in the highest
Glory to God in the highest
Glory in the highest
And on earth peace, goodwill to all men
And on earth peace goodwill to all men
