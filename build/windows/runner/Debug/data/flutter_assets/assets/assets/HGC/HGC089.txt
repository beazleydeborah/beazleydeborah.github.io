Jesus lives and reigns supreme; 
And His kingdom still remaining, 
I shall also be with Him, 
Ever living, ever reigning. 
God has promised: be it must; 
Jesus is my Hope and Trust.

Jesus lives I know full well, 
Naught from Him my heart can sever, 
Life nor death nor powers of hell, 
Joy nor grief, henceforth forever. 
None of all His saints is lost;
Jesus is my Hope and Trust.

Jesus lives, and death is now 
But my entrance into glory.
Courage, then, my soul, for thou
Hast a crown of life before thee; 
Thou shalt find thy hopes were just; 
Jesus is the Christian's trust.
