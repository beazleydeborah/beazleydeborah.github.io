Star-Spangled Banner
=
Oh, say can you see,
By the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
Through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly streaming?
=
And the rockets' red glare,
Whe bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave?
=
Oh! thus be it ever,
When freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes
Wnd the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace,
May the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made
And preserved us a nation.
=
Then conquer we must,
For our cause it is just,
And this be our motto:
"In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner
Forever shall wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave!
