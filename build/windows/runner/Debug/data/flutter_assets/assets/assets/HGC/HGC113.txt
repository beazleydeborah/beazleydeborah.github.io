Once earthly joy I craved, 
Sought peace and rest;
Mow Thee alone I seek, 
Give what is best;
This all my prayer shall be: 
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!

Let sorrow do its work,
Send grief and pain;
Sweet are Thy messengers,
Sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me;
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!
=
Then shall my latest breath 
Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry 
My heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be: 
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!
