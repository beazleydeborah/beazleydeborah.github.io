I will sing unto the Lord

For He has triumphed gloriously;

The horse and rider
                     C%
Are thrown into the sea
(repeat)

The Lord, my God, my strength, my song
Has now become my victory.
(repeat)

The Lord's my God and I will praise Him;
My Father's God and I will exalt Him.
(repeat)
