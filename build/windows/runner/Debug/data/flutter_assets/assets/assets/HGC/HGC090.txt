Jesus, lover of my soul,
D         G   A     D%
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
D                A%        
While the nearer waters roll,
D            G    A        D% 
While the tempest still is high.

Hide me, O my Savior, hide
                    G      D%
'till the storm of life is past;
D             A%   
Safe into the haven guide,
D         G  A        D% 
O receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee; 
Leave: ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me! 
All my trust on Thee is stayed -
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
=
Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace.
=
Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound. 
Make and keep me pure within. 
Thou of life the Fountain art - 
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.
