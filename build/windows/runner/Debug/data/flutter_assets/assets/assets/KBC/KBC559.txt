title:Cricket Song
=
In the dark seclusion
Of this little crevice
I've been waiting all day long
Now that all is silent
And the stars are shinin'
I finally get to sing my song

Hallelujah x4
=
I will praise my maker
With all my being
I'm not ever gonna stop
Because my time is short here
I can't just lay around
Waiting for the other shoe to drop

Hallelujah x4
=
We share a great Creator
But you've been given
So much more than I
If you've accepted Jesus
As your Lord and Savior
You'll go to meet Him when you die

Hallelujah x3
Hallelu
