A heart resigned, submissive,
Meek, my dear Redeemer's throne; 
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.

A humble, lowly, contrite heart, 
Believing, true, and clean
Which neither death nor life can part
From Him that dwells within.

A heart in ev'ry thought renewed,
And filled with love divine; 
Perfect and right, and pure and good
A copy, Lord, of Thine.
