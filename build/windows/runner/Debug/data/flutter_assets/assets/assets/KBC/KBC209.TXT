O safe and happy shelter
O refuge tried and sweet
O trysting where heaven's love
And heaven's justice meet
As to our pilgrim patriarch
That wond'rous dream was given
So seems my Savior's cross to me
A ladder up to heaven

Upon the cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me
And from my smitten heart with tears
Two wonders I confess
The wonder of His glorious love
And my unworthiness
=
I take the cross of Jesus
For my abiding place
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face
Content to let the world go by
To know no gain nor loss
My sinful self my only shame
My glory all the cross
