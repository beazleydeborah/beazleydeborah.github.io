THE WAY THAT HE LOVES
=
The way that He loves
is as fair as the day, 
that blesses my day with light.
The way that He loves 
is as soft as the breeze,
caressing the trees at night.
So tender and precious is He,
contented with Jesus I'll be.
The way that He loves
is so thrilling because
His love reaches even me.
=
The way that He loves
is as deep as the sea,
His Spirit shall be my stay.
The way that He loves
is as pure as a rose, 
much sweeter He grows each day. 
His peace hovers near like a dove, 
I know there's a heaven above.
To Jesus I'll cling,
life's a wonderful thing,
because of the way He loves.
