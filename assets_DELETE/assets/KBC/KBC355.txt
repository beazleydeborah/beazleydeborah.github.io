Monday's Verses 1 Peter 1:17-21 (NASB95)
=
17 If you address as Father the One
who impartially judges according to
each one's work, conduct yourselves
in fear during the time of your stay on earth;
18 knowing that you were not redeemed
with perishable things like silver or gold
from your futile way of life
inherited from your forefathers,
19 but with precious blood,
as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,
the blood of Christ.
