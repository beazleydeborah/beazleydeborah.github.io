The Story of His Life
=
Written on my heart is a story
that I can't explain
Broken and beaten, but I still
need love just the same
I read about this Jesus,
Supposed to be the son of God
Seems he came to save me then
he was rolled behind a stone.
=
I've been wrong wrong tonight
Jesus came to make my heart right
The way I've been clinging to sin,
holding on so tight.
=
The Story of his life, he gives 
us hope, he cried all night to 
bring us home and he was chosen.
The story of his life, he came to 
die, he gives his love until he's
broke inside.

Written on my heart is a story 
that I can't explain. Leave my 
heart open but it stays right
here in it's cage. I know that
in the morning now I'll see 
him on the cross up on a hill.
Although he was broken, my 
heart is unchanged still.

Jesus came to make my heart

holding me so tight, he's 
everything to me.
