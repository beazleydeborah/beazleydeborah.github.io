I Am Not Mine Own
=
I am not mine own
I've been bought with a price
Precious blood of Christ
I am not mine own.

I belong to You,
I've been bought with a price
Precious blood of Christ,
I belong to You,

How could I ever say,
"I will choose another way."
Knowing the price that's paid;
Precious blood of Christ.
