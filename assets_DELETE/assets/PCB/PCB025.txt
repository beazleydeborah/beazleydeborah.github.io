Be Exalted, O God
=
I will give thanks to Thee,
   O Lord, among the peoples;
I will sing praises to Thee
   Among the nations.

For Thy steadfast love is great,
   Is great to the heavens;
And Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness
   to the clouds.

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
Let Thy glory be over all the earth.
(repeat)
