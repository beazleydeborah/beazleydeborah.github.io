Only this hour is mine, 
Lord may it be used for Thee;
may every passing moment count 
for eternity my Savior;
Souls all about are dying,
dying in sin and shame; 
help me bring them the message
of Calvary's redemption 
in Thy glorious name.

Only one life to offer
take it, dear Lord, I pray; 
nothing from Thee withholding,
Thy will I now obey my Jesus;
Thou who hast freely given
Thine all in all for me, 
claim this life for Thine own, 
to be used, my Savior, 
every moment for Thee.
