Praise ye the Lord, who o'er all things 
so wondrously reigneth, 
shelters thee under His wings,

Praise ye the Lord, Who with marvelous
wisdom hath made thee! 
Decked thee with health,
and with loving hand guided 
and stayed thee;
how oft in grief hath not 
He brought thee relief, 
spreading His wings for to shade thee!

Praise ye the Lord. O let all 
that is in me adore Him! 
All that hath life and breath,
come now with praises before Him. 
Let the Amen sound 
from His people again:
gladly for aye we adore Him.
