I heard about His healing,
of His cleansing pow'r revealing, 
how He made the lame to walk again
and caused the blind to see;
and then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
come and heal my broken spirit,"
and somehow Jesus came and brought 
to me the victory.

I heard about a mansion 
He has built for me in glory; 
and I heard about the streets of gold 
beyond the crystal sea;
about the angels singing 
and the old redemption story,
and some sweet day I'll sing up there 
the song of victory.
