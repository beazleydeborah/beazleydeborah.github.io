The Lily of the Valley
=
I have found a friend in Jesus,
He's everything to me,
He's the fairest of
Ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse
And make me fully whole.
=
In sorrow He's my comfort,
In trouble He's my stay;
He tells me every care on Him to roll:
=
He's the Lily of the Valley
The Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
=
He all my griefs has taken,
And all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's
My strong and mighty tower.
He has all my sins forgiven,
And Him I do adore
From my heart, and now
He keeps me by His power.
=
Though all the world forsake me,
And Satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:
=
He's the Lily of the Valley
The Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
=
He will never, never leave me,
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith
And seek His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me,
I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna
He my hungry soul shall fill.
=
Then sweeping up to glory
To see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:
=
He's the Lily of the Valley
The Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
