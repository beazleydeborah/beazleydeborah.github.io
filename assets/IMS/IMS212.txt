The angels sang a little song
They learned from praising God 
Around the throne.
They sang it softly
In the Christ child's ear.
And then He smiled up from the straw.
His little eyes were sparkling
at what He saw:
An angel band singing near
That only Jesus could hear.
=
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb,
The only Son of the great "I Am;"
Worthy is the Lamb.
