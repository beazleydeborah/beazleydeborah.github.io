How Great Thou Art
=
O Lord my God!
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all
The worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars,
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed
=
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!
(repeat)
=
When through the woods
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook
And feel the gentle breeze;
=
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!
(repeat)
=
And when I think
That God, His Son not sparing
Sent him to die,
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross,
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died
To take away my sin;
=
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!
(repeat)
=
When Christ shall come
With shout of acclamation
And take me home,
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim,
My God, how great Thou are!
=
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!
(repeat)
