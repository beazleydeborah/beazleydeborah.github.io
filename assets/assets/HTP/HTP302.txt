Yesterday, Today, Forever
=
O how sweet the glorious message
Simple faith may claim:
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same!
Still he loves to save the sinful,
Heal the sick and lame,
Cheer the mourner, calm the tempest
Glory to His name!
=
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name, Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
=
He who pardoned erring Peter
Never need'st thou fear,
He who came to faithless Thomas
All thy doubt will clear;
He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest
Bids thee still, with love as tender,
Lean upon His breast.
=
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name, Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
=
He who 'mid the raging billows
Walked upon the sea
Still can hush the wildest tempest,
As on Galilee;
He who wept and prayed in anguish
In Gethsemane
Drinks with us each cup of trembling,
In our agony.
=
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name, Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
=
As of old He walked to Emmaus,
With them to abide,
So thru all life's way He walketh,
Ever near our side;
Soon again shall we behold Him
Hasten Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be \"this same Jesus,\"
As He went away.
=
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name, Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never
Glory to His name!
