This is my Father's world, 
the birds their carols raise,
the morning light, the lily white, 
declare their Maker's praise. 
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair; 
in the rustling grass I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me every where.

This is my Father's world,
O let me ne'er forget 
that tho' the wrong
seems oft so strong, 
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father's world: 
the battle is not done; 
Jesus who died shall be satisfied, 
and earth and heaven be one.
