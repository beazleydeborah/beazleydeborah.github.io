Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me
with a special mercy for each hour; 
all my cares He fain 
would bear and cheer me, 
He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r.
The protection of His child and treasure 
is a charge that on Himself He laid; 
"As thy days, thy strength shall 
be in measure," this pledge 
to me He made.

Help me then in ev'ry tribulation 
so to trust Thy promises, 
O Lord, that I lose not faith's sweet 
consolation offered me within Thy holy word. 
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting; 
e'er to take, as from a father's hand, 
one by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
till I reach the promised land.
