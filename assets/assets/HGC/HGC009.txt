'Tis myst'ry all. Th' Immortal dies;
who can explore His strange design. 
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
to sound the depths of love divine. 
'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,
let angel minds inquire no more.

Long my imprisoned spirit lay 
fast bound in sin and nature's night; 
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray, 
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light; 
my chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread; 
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine. 
Alive in Him, my living Head, 
and clothed in righteousness divine, 
bold I approach the eternal throne,
and claim the crown, through Christ, my own.
