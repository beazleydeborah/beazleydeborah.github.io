Elect from every nation yet one o'er all the earth,
her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth;
one holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food, 
and to one hope she presses, with every grace endued.

'Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war, 
she waits the consummation of peace forevermore;
till with the vision glorious her longing eyes are blest,
and the great Church victorious shall be the Church at
rest.
