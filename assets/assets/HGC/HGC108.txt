All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I'll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true 
Merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service too,
To Him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above, 
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
Out of the angry waves. 
He's the Master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He your Saviour wants to be - 
Be saved today.
