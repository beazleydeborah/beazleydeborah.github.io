Like a mighty army 
moves the Church of God;
brothers, we are treading 
where the saints have trod;
we are not divided, 
all one body we, 
one in hope and doctrine, 
one in charity.

Crowns and thorns may perish,
kingdoms rise and wane, 
but the Church of Jesus
constant will remain;
gates of hell can never 
'gainst that church prevail;
we have Christ's own promise, 
and that cannot fail.
=
Onward, then, ye people, 
join our happy throng,
blend with ours your voices 
in the triumph song; 
glory, laud, and honor
unto Christ the King;
this thru countless ages 
men and angels sing.
