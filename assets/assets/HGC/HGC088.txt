Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,
vaster, broader than the sea!
Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness,
Lavished all on me!

And have made it mine.

Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus, 
I behold Thee as Thou art,
And Thy love, so pure, so changeless, 
Satisfies my heart;
Satisfies its deepest longings,
meets, supplies its every need,
Compasseth me round with blessings:
Thine is love indeed!

Ever lift Thy face upon me,
As I work and wait for Thee;
Resting 'neath Thy smile, 
Lord Jesus, earth's dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father's glory, 
sunshine of my Father's face,
Keep me ever trusting, resting, 
Fill me with Thy grace.
