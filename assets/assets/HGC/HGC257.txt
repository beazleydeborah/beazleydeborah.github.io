Do not fear, for I am with you; (Do not fear, for I am with you)
be not anxious for I am your God. (Be not anxious for I am your God)
I will strengthen you, (I will strengthen you)
surely I will help you, (surely I will help you)
Surely I'll uphold you
with My righteous right hand.
Do not fear for I am with you.
