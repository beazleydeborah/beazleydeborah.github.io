Have we trials and temptations. 
Is there trouble anywhere? 
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer. 
Can we find a friend so faithful 
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness, 
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden, 
Cumbered with a load of care. 
Precious Savior, still our refuge -
Take it to the Lord in prayer. 
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer; 
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.
