On the mount of crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and wide;
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And heav'n's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.
=
Let me, all Thy love accepting,
Love Thee ever all my days;
Let me seek Thy kingdom only,
And my life be to Thy praise.
Then alone shall be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me,
Thou Thyself hast set me free.
=
In Thy truth Thou dost direct me
by Thy Spirit through Thy Word;
And Thy grace my need is meeting
As I trust in Thee, my Lord.
Of Thy fullness Thou art pouring
Thy great love and pow'r on me
Without measure, full and boundless,
Drawing out my heart to Thee.
