Abide With Me
=
Abide with me
Fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens
Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail
And comforts flee
Help of the helpless
O abide with me
=
Swift to its close
Ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim
Its glories pass away
Change and decay
In all around I see
O Thou Who changest not
Abide with me
=
I need Thy presence
Ev'ry passing hour
What but Thy grace
Can foil the tempter's pow'r
Who like Thyself
My guide and stay can be?
Thro' cloud and sunshine
O abide with me
=
Hold Thou Thy cross
Before my closing eyes
Shine thro' the gloom
And point me to the skies
Heav'n's morning breaks
And earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death O Lord
Abide with me
