No Man Careth For My Soul
topic:hymn
=
Far away on distant shores
Many souls are in despair
For their hearts are sad
And weighted down with sin
And their tear-stained faces plead
For relief from all their care
Persecution from without and fear within
=
"No man careth for my soul"
Thus cry the millions!
"No man careth for my soul"
Oh hear their plea!
Won't you give your life today
To spread the gospel
So that Christ can save their souls
And set them free?
=
Poor lost souls with blinded eyes
Grope about in sin's dark night
Kneeling down before the gods
Of wood and stone
Can we see them dying there
Still denied the gospel light
Let them go into eternity alone?
=
"No man careth for my soul"
Thus cry the millions!
"No man careth for my soul"
Oh hear their plea!
Won't you give your life today
To spread the gospel
So that Christ can save their souls
And set them free?
