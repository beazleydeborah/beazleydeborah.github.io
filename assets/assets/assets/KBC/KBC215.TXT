Shepherd Of Eager Youth
=
Shepherd of eager youth,
Guiding in love and truth
Through devious ways;
Christ our triumphant King,
We come Thy Name to sing
And here our children bring
To join Thy praise.
=
Thou art our holy Lord,
The all-subduing Word,
Healer of strife.
Thou didst Thyself abase
That from sin's deep disgrace
Thou mightest save our race
And give us life.
=
Thou art the great High Priest;
Thou hast prepared the feast
Of heavenly love;
None calls on Thee in vain,
Thee who didst not disdain
Help in Thy mortal pain,
Help from above.
=
Ever be Thou our Guide,
Our Shepherd and our pride,
Our Staff and Song;
Jesus, Thou Christ of God,
By Thy perennial Word
Lead us where Thou hast trod,
Make our faith strong.
=
So now, and till we die,
Sound we Thy praises high
And joyful sing;
Let all the holy throng
Who to Thy church belong,
Unite and swell the song
To Christ our King.
