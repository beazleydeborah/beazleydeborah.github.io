Sometimes the sky looks dark 
with not a ray of light, 
we're tossed and driven on, 
no human help in sight; 
but there is One in heav'n 
Who knows our deepest care,
let Jesus solve your problem
just go to Him in prayer.

Life's day will soon be o'er,
all storms forever past, 
we'll cross the great divide to glory, 
safe at last; 
we'll share the joys of heav'n
a harp, a home, a crown,
the tempter will be banished, 
we'll lay our burdens down.
