I look not forward,
God sees all the future,
the road that short or long
Will lead me home.
And He will face
With me its every trial,
And bear for me
The burdens that may come.
=
I look not round me,
Then would fears assail me;
So wild the tumult
Of earth's restless seas;
So dark the world,
so filled with woe and evil;
So vain the hope
Of comfort and of ease.
=
I look not inward
That would make me wretched, 
For I have naught
On which to stay my trust;
Nothing I see 
Save failures and shortcomings,
And weak endeavors
Crumbling into dust.
=
But I look up
Into the face of Jesus,
For there my heart can rest,
My fears are stilled.
And there is joy 
And love and light for darkness,
And perfect peace
And every hope fulfilled.
