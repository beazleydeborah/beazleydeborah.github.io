Keep Me Close To You
=
I'll follow you, Lord,
If you will lead me
If you'll just show me the way I should go
Keep me close to you.

Follow through the desert
Through the lonely places
Out into the darkness with you as my light
Keep me close to you.

And up the mountainside
On the wings of eagles
Soaring into your light, your spirit of life
Keep me close to you
