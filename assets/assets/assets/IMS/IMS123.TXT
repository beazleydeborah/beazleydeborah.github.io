Over the mountains and the sea,
Your river runs with love for me;
And I will open up my heart ,
And let the healer set me free.
I'm happy to be in the truth,
And I will daily lift my hands,
For I will always sing
Of when Your love came down.
=
I could sing of Your love forever.
=
Oh I feel like dancing,
It's foolishness I know.
But when the world has seen the light,
They will dance with joy like we're dancing now.
