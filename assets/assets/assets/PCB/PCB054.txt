I Lift Your Name
=
Lord my heart can grow
   so far away and cold;
And yet for me Your
   love is still the same.
Lord, I bend my knee
   in awe and fear of Thee,
My head bowed down in
   rev'rence to Your name.
=
I lift Your name Your holy name,
Jehovah God, Elohim.
The Great I Am, the Risen Lamb,
My Comforter and King.
=
Lord, my hearts desire
   is to be filled with Spirit Fire.
My purpose is to worship You alone.
Open up my soul to worship and adore,
To be a fragrance offered to Your throne.
=
I lift Your name Your holy name,
Jehovah God, Elohim.
The Great I Am, the Risen Lamb,
My Comforter and King.
