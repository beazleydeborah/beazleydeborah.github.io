Blessed Jesus, come to me,
Soothe my soul with songs of peace.
As I look to You alone,
Fill me with Your love.

Glorious, marvelous grace
   that rescued me.
Holy, worthy is the Lamb who died for me.

Mountains high and valleys low,
You will never let me go.
By Your fountain let me drink,
Fill my thirsty soul.

Glorious, marvelous grace
   that rescued me.
Holy, worthy is the Lamb who died for me.
