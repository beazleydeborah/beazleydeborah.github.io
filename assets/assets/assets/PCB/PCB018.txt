He Has Made Me Glad
=
I will enter His gates
With thanksgiving in my heart,
I will enter His courts with praise.
I will say,
   "This is the day that the Lord has made,
    I will rejoice for He has made me glad."



He has made me glad,
He has made me glad,
I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
(repeat)
