How Great You Are
=
You are deserving of all the praise, Lord,
And I am yearning to be in
   Your presence once more.
Deep inside my heart is burning,
I want to give You more,
For You're the only one that I adore.
=
How great You are,
How great You are;
You are the mighty king,
And You've come to reign in me.
How great You are,
How great You are;
I give You all the praises of my heart.
