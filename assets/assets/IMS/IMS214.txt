title:March of the Angels
order:1,2,3,2,4,3;5
=
Ten thousand angels times ten thousand
Parading through a split in time
They march through the ages singing,
Angels of every kind,
Every different kind.
=
There are seraphim,
There are cherubim,
There are angels short and tall.
With a trumpet blast
and cymbal crash,
They wait to hear God's call,
They wait to hear God's call.
=
Ten million angels times ten million
Come marching into space and dreams.
They wondrously serve Jehovah,
Singing of secret things,
secret, holy things.
=
They sing of Eden and the snake,
And the difference evil makes.
They sing of Jacob and of Lot,
And the law that was forgot.
They sing of life in a foreign land,
Fiery furnaces and lion's den.
They sing of Jesus and his birth,
And how He gives His children worth.
=
Hallelujah, amen!
Hallelujah, amen!
