title:Hosanna
order:1,2,3,2,4,2
=
I see the King glory
Coming on the clouds of fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing
=
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
=
I see a generation
Rising up to take the place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Starting as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees
=
Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like you have loved me
Break my heart for what breaks yours
Everything I am for your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity
