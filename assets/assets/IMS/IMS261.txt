O the Love of My Redeemer
=
Highest heights or darkest deep
Be there pain or poverty
There is nothing that can keep
My Redeemer's love from me
=
O the love of my Redeemer
Never failing come what may
He has purchased my forgiveness
And has washed my sins away
=
All alone though I may feel
All the world my enemy
Still there's no one that can steal
My Redeemer's love from me
=
Although burdened by the weight
Of great trial or tragedy
None of these can separate
My Redeemer's love from me
=
Though the earth's foundations shake
Driving wind or raging sea
Neither death nor life can take
My Redeemer's love from me
=
Through this world's few passing days
And through all eternity
I will never cease to praise
My Redeemer's love for me
