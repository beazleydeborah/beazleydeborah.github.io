Safe Am I
=
Safe am I (Safe am I)
Safe am I (Safe am I)
In the hollow of His hand
Sheltered o'er (Sheltered o'er)
Sheltered o'er (Sheltered o'er)
With His love forevermore
No ill can harm me
No foe alarm me
For He keeps both day and night
Safe am I (Safe am I)
Safe am I (Safe am I)
In the hollow of His hand.
