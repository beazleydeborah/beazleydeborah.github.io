'Twas in the moon of wintertime
When all the birds had fled,
That mighty Gitchi Manitou
Sent angel choirs instead.
Before their light the stars grew dim,
And wand'ring hunters heard the hymn:

   "Jesus your King is born,
     Jesus is born,
       In excelsis gloria!"
=
Within a lodge of broken bark
The tender Babe was found,
A ragged robe of rabbit skin
Enwrapped His beauty 'round
And as the hunter braves drew nigh,
The angel song rang loud and high:

   "Jesus your King is born,
     Jesus is born,
       In excelsis gloria!"
=
The earliest moon of wintertime
Is not so round and fair,
As was the ring of glory on
The helpless Infant there,
While Chiefs from far before Him knelt
With gifts of fox and beaver pelt.

   "Jesus your King is born,
     Jesus is born,
       In excelsis gloria!"
=
O children of the forest free,
O sons of Manitou,
The Holy Child of earth and Heav'n
Is born today for you
Come, kneel before the radiant Boy
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy.

   "Jesus your King is born,
     Jesus is born,
       In excelsis gloria!"
