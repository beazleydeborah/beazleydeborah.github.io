Shoo-bee doo-wee daht-n doo wah,
Shoo-bee doo-wee daht-n doo wah,
Now, Jezebel was their queen;
A meaner queen you've never seen!
She prayed daily to a stone god,
She bowed and scraped and acted odd.

Then when she heard what Elijah had done,
She vowed to get even for everyone,
She screamed (she screamed) 
and raged, (and raged)
Her face turned red, she said,
"This time tomorrow you'll be dead, so dead!
Enough is enough; hear what I've said:
  (I wanna go home)
"This time tomorrow, oh!
=
You'll be dead! Dead! Oh, so dead!"
She said, "Watch your head!"
Dah-daht-n dah-dah, daht-n doo-wah,
Dah-daht-n dah-dah, daht-n doo-wah,
Doot doot doot doot shoo be doo wee
Doot doot doot doot shoo be doo wee
=
You'll be dead, oh so dead!
Yes, my fine friend, you'll be dead,
Enough is enough; hear what I've said:
This time tomorrow, oh! you'll be dead!
