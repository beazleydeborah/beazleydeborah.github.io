When the music fades, all is stripped away,
             A7sus%
And I simply come;
D2                A2%
Longing just to bring
                        Em7%
   something that's of worth
                      A7sus%
That will bless your heart.

I'll bring you more than a song,
                Em7%
For a song in itself
               D/F#        A7sus%
   is not what you have required.
Em7              D/F#     A7sus%
You search much deeper within
   through the way things appear;
Em7            D/F#%
You're looking into my heart.

I'm coming back to the heart of worship,

And it's all about you, all about you, Jesus.

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it,

When it's all about you, all about you, Jesus.

King of endless worth,
                Em7%
No one could express
               A7sus%
How much you deserve.
D2                   A2%
Though I'm weak and poor,
               Em7%
All I have is yours,
             A7sus%
Every single breath.
