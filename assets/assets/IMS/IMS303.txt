Oh, there once were some wise men, tra-la,
Who had a great problem, tra-la.
They were asked to describe
What went on inside
Of the head of their king, tra-la.
Tra la la, tra la la
Tra la la, la la, la la!

What went on inside
Of the head of their king, tra-la.

Now the king was angry tra-la,
He ranted and shouted, tra-la,
Got them up from their beds 
And threatened their heads
If they did not obey, tra la.
Tra la la, tra la la
Tra la la, la la, la la!
Got them up from their beds 
And threatened their heads
If they did not obey, tra la.

So they begged for mercy tra-la
But he would not listen tra-la
"Either tell me my dream"
He started to scream
"Or you'll part with your heads tra-la
