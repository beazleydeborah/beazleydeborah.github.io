Isaiah 53
order:1,2,2,3
topic:scripture
=
They mocked Him and abused Him, 
And looked the other way. 
They scourged Him and accused Him; 
Yet nothing did He say. 
The ones he loved condemned Him; 
The Lamb made no reply. 
He took our sins upon Him. 
When they led Him away to die.
=
He is the Lamb that God provided; 
He is the final sacrifice. 
Oh, He is worthy, praise Jehovah! 
Praise the Lord, hallelujah!

Praise the Lord, Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah!
