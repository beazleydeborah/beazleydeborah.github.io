Thy work alone, Oh Christ,
Can ease this weight of sin.
Thy blood alone, Oh Lamb of God,
Can give me peace within.
Thy love to me, Oh God,
Not mine Oh Lord to Thee
Can rid me of this dark unrest
And set my spirit free.
=
Thy grace alone Oh God 
To me can pardon speak
Thy power alone Oh Lamb of God
Can this sore bondage break
No other work save Thine
No other blood will do
No strength but that which is divine
Can bear me safely through
=
I praise the God of grace;
I trust his truth and might,
He calls me His, I call Him mine
My God, My Joy, My Light.
My Lord has saved my life
And freely pardon gives;
I love because He first loved me
I live because He lives.
