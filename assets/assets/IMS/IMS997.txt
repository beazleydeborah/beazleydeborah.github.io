1 Peter 2:19-25

21 To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you,
leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 
22 “He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his 
mouth.” 
23 When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate;
when he suffered, he made no threats.
Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
24 “He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that
we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his
wounds you have been healed.” 
25 For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have
returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
