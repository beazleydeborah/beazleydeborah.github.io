Ring The Bells

Ring the bells, ring the bells,
Let the whole world know
Christ was born in Bethlehem
Many years ago:
Born to die that man might live,
Came to earth new life to give,
Born of Mary, born so low,
Many years ago.
God the Father gave His Son,
Gave His own beloved One
To this wicked, sinful earth,
To bring mankind His love, new birth:
Ring the bells, ring the bells,
Let the whole world know
Christ the Savior lives today
As He did so long ago!
