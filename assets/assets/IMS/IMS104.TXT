Little By Little
=
Little by little every day
Little by little in every way
Jesus is changing me
Since I made a turn-about face
I've been growing in His grace
Jesus is changing me

He's changing me
My precious Jesus
I'm not the same person that I used to be
Sometimes it's slow going
But there's a knowing
That some day, perfect I will be
