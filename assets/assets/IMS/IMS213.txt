And the Lord Came Passing By
=
And the Lord came passing by
And a great strong wind
Blew from the sky,
Then it tossed big rocks around like sand,
But the Lord 
Was not in the wind.
=
Then the earth began to shake
And the mountain began to quake,
And it seemed the world would surely break,
But the Lord was not the earthquake.
=
After that, there came the fire,
The flames leaped up higher and higher,
Glowing red like an angry choir!
But the Lord was not in the fire,
The Lord was not in the fire.
=
He came like a soft wind blowing,
Loving, kind and all knowing.
He spoke words to calm all fear;
He promised help and friends were near,
He promised help and friends were 
ever near, near, near.
