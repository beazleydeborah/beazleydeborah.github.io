That Sneaky Snake
=
That sneaky snake slipped upon the scene,
His eyes were red and his skin was green.
He said, "Open, open up your eyes,
Listen, oh listen, to all of my lies,
Listen, oh listen, to all of my lies.
=
That slimy snake slid right up a tree,
Said "Look here, Eve, come and talk to me."
Then he hissed and ate an apple raw.
Eve looked at him and she liked what she saw,
Eve looked at him and she liked what she saw.
=
She took a bite from the fruit so red,
And in that moment sin filled her head.
She slid with the snake to Adam's place,
And on that day they both fell from God's grace,
And on that day they both fell from God's grace.
