And the rains came tumbling down.
The rains came down
 and the floods came up
The rains came down

And the house on the rock stood firm

 his house upon the sand

And the house on the sand fell flat

So build your life on the Lord Jesus Christ
So build your life on the Lord Jesus Christ
So build your life on the Lord Jesus Christ
And the blessings will come down
The blessings come down
 as your prayers go up
The blessings come down
 as your prayers go up
The blessings come down
 as your prayers go up
So build your life on the Lord
