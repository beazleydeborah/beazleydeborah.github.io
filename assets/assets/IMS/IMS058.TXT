Abraham
=
I'm a twice born child of Abraham
   in the covenant God made with him,
I thank God for the faithfulness of Abraham
He taught me how to live
   believing in my God.
See him standing there a desert man,
   see him gazing at the skies
=
Hear the Lord saying,
   so shall your descendants be
As countless as the stars
   like sand upon the shore
Abraham covenant man
   trusting in the promises of God
Abraham covenant man He taught me
   how to live believing in my God.
=
See him climbing Mount Moriah
   now see him binding Isaac there
Hear him cry as he lifts
   the knife to slay his son
The angel stays his hand
   and points him to the ram
=
Abraham covenant man
   trusting in the promises of God
Abraham covenant man He taught me
   how to live believing in my God.
(repeat twice)
