Many and Great, O God
=
Many and great, O God, are Your works,
Maker of earth and sky.
Your hands have set the heavens with stars;
Your fingers spread the mountains and plains.
Lo, at Your word the waters were formed;
Deep seas obey Your voice.
=
Grant unto us communion with You,
O star-abiding One.
Come unto us and dwell with us;
With You are found the gifts of life.
Bless us with life that has no end,
Eternal life with You.
