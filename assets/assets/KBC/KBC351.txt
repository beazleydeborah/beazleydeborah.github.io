Philippians 3:13&14
=
D%
Brethren, I do not regard myself
          G%
as having laid hold of it yet;
but one thing I do:
   A%
forgetting what lies behind
             Bm%
and reaching forward
to what lies ahead,
D       A%
I press on toward the goal
        Bm           G%
for the prize of the upward call
         D       A%
of God in Christ Jesus.
   G        A    D%
