They that wait upon the Lord
Shall renew their strength;
          B                      E-(7)%
They will mount up with wings as eagles,
           A%
They shall run and not be weary;
           E            E%
They shall walk and not faint!
                 A        E     B   E-A-E%  
Teach me, Lord; teach me, Lord, to wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait-
   down on my knees
        B              (7)%
Till in Your own good time
    E         (7)%
You answer my pleas,
         A              E% 
Teach me not to rely on what others do,
       B                     A           E%
But to wait in prayer for an answer from You.
