All Day Song
=
Love Him in the morning,
When you see the sun arising, 
Love Him in the evening
'Cause He took you through the day, 
And in the in-between time
When you feel the pressure coming, 
Remember that He loves you
And He promises to stay.

When you think you've got to worry, 
'Cause it seems the thing to do, 
Remember He aint in a hurry, 
He's always got time for You
