I will instruct you and teach you
          G              D%
   in the way you should go;
G      A                 D   A%
I will guide you with My eye.
D                           G        D%   
Do not be like the horse or like the mule,
A%
Which have no understanding,
D%
Which must be harnessed
A%
   with bit and bridle,
                        D%
Else they will not come near you.
