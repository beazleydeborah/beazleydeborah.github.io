He Knows, He Cares, He Rules
=
The one that sees the end from the begining,

The one that spoke the universe into being

Knows the hairs on our head, our worries and fears.

Knows the ones He has saved, His children from the years
=
He knows, He cares, He rules

He has sought us like precious jewels

So when you're drowning in a sea of hurt

Expect the Lord to work
=
While we were yet sinners Christ died for us

Helpless in a fallen world, condemned to brokenness

The joy of salvation, redeemed to live again

A Father that's benevolent, and a Son that's conquered sin
=
He knows, He cares, He rules

He has sought us like precious jewels

So when you're drowning in a sea of hurt

Expect the Lord to work
=
Former of the world, the mountains, and the seas

Creator of the stars, constellations, and galaxies

Victor over sin, the cross, the grave, and hell

It's not just salvation that He gives, it's purpose as well
=
He knows, He cares, He rules

He has sought us like precious jewels

So when you're drowning in a sea of hurt

Expect the Lord to work
