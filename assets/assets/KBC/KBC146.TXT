Dear Jesus

Dear Jesus,
Thou art everything to me,
And everything I own
I give to Thee;
My wealth, my all,
But most of all,
Dear Lord, I give myself to Thee
=
Dear Jesus,
Thou hast bled and died for me
And washed away my sins
On Calvary
You cleansed my soul,
Tou made me whole,
Dear Lord, I give myself to Thee
=
Dear Jesus,
Thou has led me day by day,
And set my will to follow
All the way
To bear my cross,
To suffer loss
Dear Lord, I give myself to Thee
