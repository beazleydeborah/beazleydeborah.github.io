Pour Out My Heart
=
Here I am once again.
I pour out my heart
For I know that You hear every cry.
You are listening
No matter what state my heart is in.
You are faithful to answer
With words that are true
And a hope that is real.
As I feel Your touch
You bring a freedom to all that's within
In the safety of this place
=
I'm longing to pour out my heart
To say that I love You
Pour out my heart
To say that I need You
Pour out my heart
To say that I'm thankful
Pour out my heart
To say that You're wonderful.
