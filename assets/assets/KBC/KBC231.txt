This World is Not My Home
=
This world is not my home I'm just a passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
=
Oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
=
Just over in Gloryland we'll live eternally 
the saints on every hand are shouting victory
Their songs of sweetest praise
drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
=
Oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
