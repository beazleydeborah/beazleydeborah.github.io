O Happy Day

The greatest day in history
Death is beaten
You have rescued me
Sing it out Jesus is alive
The empty cross
The empty grave
Life eternal
You have won the day
Shout it out

Oh happy day, happy day
I'll never be the same

Free at last
Meeting face to face
I am Yours Jesus You are mine
Endless joy, perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate Jesus is alive
He's alive
