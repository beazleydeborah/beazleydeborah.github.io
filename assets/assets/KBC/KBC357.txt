Ephesians 4:29, James 3:2-6
Order:1,2,1,3,1
=
You must let
no unwholesome word
come out of your mouth, 
but only what is beneficial
for the building up
of the one in need,
that it may give grace
to those who hear.
=
For we all stumble in many ways.
If someone does not stumble in what he says, 
he is a perfect individual,
able to control the entire body as well.
And if we put bits
into the mouths of horses
to get them to obey us,
then we guide their entire bodies.
Look at ships too:
Though they are so large
and driven by harsh winds,
they are steered by a tiny rudder
wherever the pilot's inclination directs.
=
So too the tongue is a small part of the body,
yet it has great pretensions.
Think how small a flame
sets a huge forest ablaze.
And the tongue is a fire!
The tongue represents
the world of wrongdoing
among the parts of our bodies.
It pollutes the entire body
and sets fire to the course
of human existence
- and is set on fire by hell.
