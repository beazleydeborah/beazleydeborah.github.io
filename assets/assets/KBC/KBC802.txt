Better Than Life
=
Better than the riches of this world
Better than the sound of my friends voices
Better than the biggest dreams in my heart
And that's just the start
Better than getting what I say I need
Better than living the life that I wan't to
Better than the love anyone could give
Your love is
=
You hold me now in Your arms
You never let me go
And You oh Lord made the sunshine
the moonlight and the night sky
You give me breath and all Your love
I give my heart to You
Because I can't stop falling in love with You
I'll never stop falling in love with You
I can't stop falling in love with You
I'll never stop falling in love with You
