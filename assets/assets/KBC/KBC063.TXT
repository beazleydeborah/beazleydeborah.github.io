Jesus Shall Reign
=
Jesus shall reign where're the sun
Doth its successive courses run
His kingdom spread from shore to shore
Till moon shall wax and wane no more
=
From north to south the princes meet
To pay their homage at His feet
While western empires own their Lord
And savage tribes attend His word
=
To Him shall endless prayer be made
And endless praises crown His head
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice
=
People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings to His name
