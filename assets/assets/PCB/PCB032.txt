I Really Want To Worship You My Lord
=
You laid aside Your majesty,
Gave up ev'rything for me,
Suffer'd at the hands of those You had
   created.
You took all my guilt and shame,
When You died and rose again;
Now today You reign in heav'n and earth
   exalted.
=
I really want to worship You, my Lord,
You have won my heart and I am Yours,
Forever and ever;
I will love You.
You are the only one who died for me,
Gave Your life to set me free,
So I lift my voice to You in adoration.
