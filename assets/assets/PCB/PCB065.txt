We Believe (In God the Father)
=
We believe in God the Father,
   Maker of the universe.
And in Christ, the Son, our Savior.
   come to us by virgin birth.
We believe He died to save us,
   bore our sins, was crucified;
Then, from death, He rose victorious,
   ascended to the Father's side.
=
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
=
We believe He sends His Spirit
   on His Church with gifts of pow'r;
God, His Word of truth affirming,
   sends us to the nations now.
He will come again in glory,
   judge the living and the dead;
Ev'ry knee shall bow before Him,
   then must ev'ry tongue confess.
=
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all;
Lord of all.
