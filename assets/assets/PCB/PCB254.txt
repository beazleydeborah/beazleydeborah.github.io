You Are So Faithful
=
Like the sun that rises ev'ry day,
You are so faithful, Lord, You are faithful.
Like the rain that you send,
And ev'ry breath that I breathe,
You are so faithful, Lord.
=
Like a rose that comes alive ev'ry spring,
You are so faithful, Lord, You are faithful.
Like the life that You give
   to ev'ry beat of my heart,
You are so faithful, Lord.
=
I see a cross and the price You had to pay,
I see the blood that washed my sins away;
And in the midst of a storm,
Through the wind and the waves,
You'll still be faithful, You'll still be faithful.
When the stars refuse to shine
   and time is no more.
You'll still be faithful,
You'll still be faithful, Lord.
