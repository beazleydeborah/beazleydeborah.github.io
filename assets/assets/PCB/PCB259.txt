Your Kindness
=
Waiting for angry words to sear my soul,
Knowing I don't deserve another chance;
Suddenly the kindest words I've ever heard
Come flooding through my heart.

It's Your kindness that leads us to
   repentance, O Lord;
Knowing that you love us
   no matter what we do.
Makes us want to love You.

No excuse, no one to blame,
   nowhere to hide;
The eyes of God have found
   my failures, found my pain.
He understands my weaknesses
   and knows my shame,
But His heart never leaves me.
