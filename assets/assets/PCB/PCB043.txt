Bind Us Together
=
Bind us together, Lord, Bind us together
With cords that cannot be broken,
Bind us together, Lord, bind us together
Bind us together with love.
=
There is only one God,
There is only one King;
There is only one body,
That is why I sing.
=
Bind us together, Lord, Bind us together
With cords that cannot be broken,
Bind us together, Lord, bind us together
Bind us together with love.
