One God

Hear O Israel, the Lord, thy God, is one God,
Hallelujah!
Hear O Israel, the Lord, thy God, is one God,
Hallelujah!
And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God,
With all thy heart, with all thy might.
And give Him glory, King of glory,
In His ways delight.
REPEAT
=
There is no other Savior,
No other life redeemer.
We all give our praise to You
And lift our voice in declaration.

Hear O Israel, the Lord, thy God, is one God,
Hallelujah!
Hear O Israel, the Lord, thy God, is one God,
Hallelujah!
