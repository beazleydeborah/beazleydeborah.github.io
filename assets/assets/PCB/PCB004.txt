All Heaven Declares

All heaven declares
   the glory of the Risen Lord;
Who can compare
   with the beauty of the Lord?
Forever He will be
   the Lamb upon the throne;
I gladly bow the knee
   and worship Him alone.

I will proclaim
   the glory of the Risen Lord;
Who once was slain
   to reconcile man to God.
Forever You will be
   the Lamb upon the throne;
I gladly bow the knee
   and worship You alone.
