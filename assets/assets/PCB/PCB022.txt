This is What I Believe
=
I believe in God, the Father,
Maker of heaven and earth;
And in Jesus, His only Son,
Born of virgin birth.
On a cross He was crucified,
He descended into Hell;
But the third day Jesus rose again,
He's alive and well.
=
This is what I believe,
It is written on my heart.
This is what I believe,
Ev'ry promise, ev'ry part.
This is what I believe.
=
I believe the Lord's in heaven,
Worship in majesty there;
I believe He'll come again
And meet us in the air.
I believe He's in the Church
To keep us on the way;
Leading onward in the truth
to that great Eternal Day.

This is what I believe,
It is written on my heart.
This is what I believe,
Ev'ry promise, ev'ry part.
This is what I believe.
