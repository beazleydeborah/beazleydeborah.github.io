The Servant Song
=
Brother, let me be your servant,
Let me be as Christ to you.
Pray that I might have the grace to
  let you be my servant too.
=
We are pilgrims on a journey,
We are brothers on the road.
We are here to help each other
  walk the mile and bear the load.
=
I will hold the Christ-light for you,
In the nighttime of your fear,
I will hold my hand out to you,
  speak the peace you long to hear.
=
I will weep when you are weeping,
When you laugh, I'll laugh with you.
I will share your joy and sorrow
  till we've seen this journey through.
=
When we sing to God in heaven,
We shall find such harmony.
Born of all we've know together
  of Christ's love and agony.
=
Brother, let me be your servant,
Let me be as Christ to you,
Pray that I might have the grace to
  let you be my servant too.
