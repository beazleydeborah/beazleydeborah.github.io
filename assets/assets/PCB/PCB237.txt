More Precious Than Silver
=
Lord, you are more precious than silver,
Lord, you are more costly than gold;
Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds,
And nothing I desire compares with you.
(repeat)
=
Lord, you are more precious than silver,
Lord, you are more costly than gold;
Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds,
And nothing I desire compares with you.

Lord you're present at the morning hours,
As I watch the sun rise
And Lord you're present at the noon day hour
as it shines so bright.
And Lord you're present at the end of the day
as I watch the sun set
And nothing I desire compares with you.
=
Lord, you are more precious than silver,
Lord, you are more costly than gold;
Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds,
And nothing I desire compares with you.
=
I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee, 
I exalt Thee, O Lord!
(repeat)
