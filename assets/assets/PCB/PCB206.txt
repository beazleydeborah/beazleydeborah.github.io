When I Look into Your Holiness
=
When I look into your holiness,
When I gaze into your loveliness,
When all things that surround become
   shadows in the light of You.
=
When I've found the Joy
   of reaching Your heart,
When my will becomes
   enthroned in Your love,
When all things that surround become
   shadows in the light of You.
=
I worship You, I worship You;
The reason I live is to worship You.
I worship You, I worship You;
The reason I live is to worship You.
