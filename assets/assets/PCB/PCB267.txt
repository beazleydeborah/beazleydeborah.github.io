Chorus:
Glory, glory Lord, we give you glory, Lord;

You who go down to the sea,
You who live in the islands,
If you live in the city,
Lift your voice and sing out.

Glory, glory Lord, we give you glory, Lord;
Glory, glory Lord, You are the  mighty God.
You are the mighty God.

Sing to the Lord a new song,
Sing His praise to the ends of the earth;
Let ev'ry nation tell it,
Til ev'ry man has heard.
=
Glory, glory Lord, we give you glory, Lord;
Glory, glory Lord, You are the mighty God.
You are the mighty God.
You are the mighty God.
