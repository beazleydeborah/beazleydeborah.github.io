Nobody Like You
=
There is nobody else so worthy of praise.
No one so wonderful in so many ways,
  oh Lord.
You are the one who can claim the highest
  place,
Up in heaven and in our hearts too.
There is nobody else, oh Lord, nobody like
  You.
=
These foolish earthly pow'rs parading
  their might
Can't match the majesty of one starry night,
  oh Lord.
You gave the word and the universe was
  made,
You'll give the word when it's through.
There is nobody else, oh Lord, nobody
  like You.
=
How can we speak of love apart from
  Your name;
As we remember when You bore all our
  shame?  Oh, Lord.
You paid our debt when You died upon
  the cross,
And You rose again that we might live too.
There is nobody else, oh Lord, nobody
  like You.
There is nobody, there's just nobody like You.
There is nobody, there's just nobody like You.
Oh, Lord, nobody like You.
