Ephesians 2:4,8,9
=
For by grace you have 
been saved through faith; 
And this is not your own doing,
it is the gift, it is the gift, 
it is the gift of God.

For God, who is rich in mercy, 
out of the great love with 
which He loved us, even though 
we were dead in our trespasses, 
made us alive, made us alive,
made us alive with Christ.
