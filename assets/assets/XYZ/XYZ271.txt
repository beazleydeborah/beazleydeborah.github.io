HOLD TO GOD'S UNCHANGING HAND

Time is fill'd with swift transition; 
Naught of earth unmoved can stand. 
Build your hopes on things eternal; 
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave you, 
Whatsoever years may bring;
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world's vain riches, 
That so rapidly decay. 
Seek to gain the heav'nly treasures; 
They will never pass away!

When your journey is completed, 
If to God you have been true, 
Fair and bright the home in glory, 
Your enraptured soul shall view!

Hold to God's unchanging hand. 
Hold to God's unchanging hand. 
Build your hopes on things eternal;
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
