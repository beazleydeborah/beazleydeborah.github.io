Meet Us Here
=
Lord we have come to this house
   where we love to sing Your praises;
We lift our hearts and our hands
   to the King of all the ages.
Hear us, Lord, we pray.
Come, Jesus, come, come fill this place.
=
Meet us here,
Meet us here, Lord
We are few but we are strong
   when You surround us.
Meet us here,
Meet us here, Lord
As we gather in Your name meet us here.
