How Excellent Your Name Is
=
O Lord, our Lord,
How excellent Your name is,
How excellent Your name in all the earth.
Your glory fills the heavens
beyond the farthest star,
How excellent Your name in all the earth.
=
When I think about the heavens,
The moon and all the stars,
I wonder what You ever saw in me;
But you took me and You loved me
and You've given me a crown,
And now I'll praise Your name eternally.
=
O Lord, our Lord,
How excellent Your name is,
How excellent Your name in all the earth.
Your glory fills the heavens
beyond the farthest star,
How excellent Your name in all the earth.
