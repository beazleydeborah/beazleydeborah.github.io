"Fear not, I am with thee, 
O be not dismayed, 
for I am thy God,

I call thee to go, 
the rivers of sorrow 
shall not overflow;
for I will be with Thee,

"When through fiery trials
thy pathway shall lie, 
My grace, all sufficient,

I only design Thy dross to consume, 
and thy gold to refine.

"The soul that on Jesus 
hath leaned for repose, 
I will not, I will not desert to his foes; 
that soul though all hell 
shall endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no never, 
no never forsake."
