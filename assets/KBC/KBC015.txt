Ephesians 2:4, 8-9

=
For by grace you have been saved
   through faith,
And this is not your own doing. 
It is the gift, it is the gift,
It is the gift of God. 
=
For God who is rich in mercy,
Out of the great love
With which He loved us, 
Even though we were dead
In our trespasses, 
Made us alive, made us alive,
Made us alive with Christ. 
=
For by grace you have been saved 
   through faith,
And this is not your own doing. 
It is the gift, it is the gift,
It is the gift of God.
