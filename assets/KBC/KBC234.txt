People Need the Lord
=
Everyday they pass me by
I can see it in their eyes
Empty people filled with care
Headed who knows where

On they go through private pain
Living fear to fear
Laughter hides the silent cries
Only Jesus hears
=
People need the Lord, People need the Lord
At the end of broken dreams
He's the open door
People need the Lord, People need the Lord
When will we realize
That people need the Lord
=
We are called to take his light 
to a world where wrong seems right 
What could be too great a cost for
Sharing life with one who's lost
Through His love our hearts can feel
All the grief they bear.
They must hear the words of life
Only we can share
=
People need the Lord, People need the Lord
At the end of broken dreams
He's the open door
People need the Lord, People need the Lord
When will we realize
That we must give our lives
For people need the Lord
People need the Lord
